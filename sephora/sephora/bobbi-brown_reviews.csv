Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P427430,109,$46.00,3.9908,Skin Long-Wear Weightless Foundation SPF 15,brown,black,"This foundation is absolutely my favorite and is worth spending the money for it. In my opinion, the coverage is medium and it looks very natural as well as not being too matte. Definitely will keep using this forever.",dullness,dark,combination,5,shayla4338
Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P427430,109,$46.00,3.9908,Skin Long-Wear Weightless Foundation SPF 15,blue,auburn,"I love this foundation. I believe that it is a great everyday foundation for people who's skin is already fairly clear or wanting a natural look as this unfortunately is in no way a full coverage foundation. The coverage is more a fuller light to fuller medium coverage ( Depending on application method). It evens out the skin and does not cake. The matte is not the flat matte of yesterday which is great its more of an up to date velvet finish and this product does keep my combination skin at bay as I do not get oily fast(I do still set with powder as I powder everything even tinted moisturizer :P),  but I am not sure how well the finish will hold up for oily skinned people. I found that this foundation does not crease or make me break out either which is huge as I breakout to basically every foundation known to man kind, even those claiming to be hypoallergenic. This foundation does have that signature lavender smell however, it does settle down after a bit and it does not irritate my skin. This foundation is also very breathable it does not feel as though I am wearing a mask. This foundation could have the potential to cling to dry patches but if you use a hydrating primer/ moisturizer whether that be a liquid or spray you should be fine. As far as the shade goes , this shade warm ivory I find flatters many skin tones in the light range however even though it says ivory do not mistake this color for being very pale, as I originally thought it was until I swatched it myself in store. I would not recommend this color for women with quite fair skin but more for women with light skin maybe even light to medium. Oh and it blends out smoothly and I also enjoy the texture it's not too runny or too thick. I would recommend giving this a go for all of you ladies and men out there with combination, sensitive or if you just want a nice natural looking foundation for the skin, and I hope that you will not be disappointed.:)",darkCircles,light,combination,5,Fuberry

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P427430,109,$46.00,3.9908,Skin Long-Wear Weightless Foundation SPF 15,brown,brunette,"I've been using Bobbi Brown for a long time (a little over 10 years now). And of all the oil free long wear foundations the brand has came out with this is by far my favorite! I definitely wouldn't call this full coverage by any means. For Bobbi this is about as full coverage as you're going to get. It takes at least two applications to get ""full coverage"". It wears very well and lasts all day (about 8-10 hours). I have combination to oily skin with my nose being the worst and this still holds up without breaking down. I do have to powder around 4 hours and again at 8. But for my skin that's expected. I also use the vitamin enriched face base moisturizer underneath. The shade range is going to be slightly different than what you'd normally wear from Bobbi, for example I usually use Sand in Bobbi's foundations but I had to go to Cool Sand with this. Sand looked pasty. It's a very pretty foundation. I also recommend using the full coverage concealer along with it. Absolute perfection!!! Xoxo",aging,fair,combination,5,freakingclassy

I am an oily, acne-prone skin girl and no foundation that was matte ever sat on my skin right or was the right color. I got ColorIQ matched at a Sephora and after a few tries this was the one that worked. It looks just amazing on the skin!! Matte but not drying, smells great, and does not break me out. It also controls oil for a hugely long time. I was iffy about buying because of the price, and instead went with the Fenty beauty foundation thinking it would give me the same coverage and finish. There was no comparison!!! I returned it right away and just took the plunge with this. Honestly the best foundation out there right now. Holds up after an 8 hour working shift (moving) and just looks amazing on the skin. I've gotten so many compliments since I've been wearing it.

Unfortunately, I thought the deeper, darker colors had a pretty red undertone, which I never noticed before from Bobbi Brown. Normally Bobbi Brown does great with her shades. The worst part about this foundation is that it broke my face out. I wasn’t sure if it was truly the foundation that was the culprit. I wore it Saturday and broke out. Face started clearing up Sunday. Wore it Monday, broke out. Face started clearing up Tuesday. Just to be certain I wore it again on Wednesday, broke out.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P427430,109,$46.00,3.9908,Skin Long-Wear Weightless Foundation SPF 15,brown,black,"I got a sample of this and I'm wearing it for the first time today so I can't review how it wears all day for oily skin and whether it causes breakouts, but I will say that it is a PERFECT color match for my skin. 

I have multiple types of yellow undertones on my face so I always have to wear two foundations no matter the brand (not a big deal to me since I prefer my-skin-but-better makeup and it usually takes 2 shades to get that look). For reference, I'm usually somewhere between 3y07 to 3y10 depending on the time of year. I have warm yellow undertones on the edge of my face that are fairly easy to match, but cool yellow undertones in the center of my face and down my neck/chest that become impossible to match in the winter when my skin gets pale.  Most warm/golden/yellow foundations tend to just sit on top of my skin instead of sinking in like they should for a spot-on color match. This didn't come up as a match for me online, but I tried it on a whim in store and I'm so glad I did because it matches the extra cool yellow, olive undertones that show up in my skin perfectly. So, I highly recommend this as a starting point for anyone like me who might be struggling to find the right shade for their yellow olive undertones.

Color stuff aside, this is probably one of the weirdest textures I've encountered in a foundation, but not in a bad way. It doesn't dry quickly but it also doesn't spread as easily as other foundations, so I think it's easier to work in small sections on your face using your fingers or a flat brush to lay on then blend as you go instead of dabbing on all over then blending all at once. Even though it doesn't spread like other foundations, it also doesn't ball up when you're trying to buff it in--again, magic. I also think it works better when you apply in very thin layers to build up to the coverage you want instead of putting a lot on at once.",acne,tan,combination,5,uwsbeautyjunkie

It’s definitely not full coverage when you first apply, if you want more coverage surprisingly a sponge is the better option. You can build it up to a fuller coverage , I don’t know what it is but it covers blemishes without looking cakey, doesn’t cling to dry patches and controls oil so well.

This foundation is excellent...it gives a flawless look that doesn't look artificial. It looks just like my skin but more airbrushed.

This foundation has a beautiful, natural skin like appearance that really seems to blur imperfections, pores, fine lines, you name it. I wouldn't consider it full coverage, but it is buildable to a high medium. It dries down to a soft matte finish that isn't drying or patchy. The consistency reminds me of the new Laura Mercier Flawless Fusion foundation, but nowhere near as drying. I have combo dry skin and it works just fine, however it would probably suit someone with combo to oily skin a lot better. I did not feel a need to set this foundation with powder (but I do it anyways). It wore very well throughout the day and did not separate or settle in any fine lines or creases. I used it with both a beauty blender and a buffing brush; surprisingly enough I think it works best with the brush. I tried this foundation with and without a primer (both silicone and water based), and I personally think it looked better without primer. I had this foundation in the shade Warm Sand 2.5, the color range in this foundation is not consistent with the other Bobbi foundations. I'm usually Sand 2 but found that shade in this particular foundation very cool toned and almost grayish looking. Warm Sand is great for fair/light skin with olive/yellow undertones.

Pros:
*Nice color range with a good mix of undertones.
*Depending on application and amount used, this can go anywhere from a light coverage to the fuller side of medium. Two pumps with a buffing brush gets me a nice medium coverage that evens out minor discoloration.
*Finish is pretty natural. I can still see it on my skin, but it doesn't look cakey. Neither matte nor dewy on my skin. Before setting, finish is satin-like.

Cons:
*STICKY! Why am I not seeing more people commenting this? This foundation does not set no matter how long you leave it. It remains very tacky and will transfer. I find that to get rid of the stickiness, I have to set my entire face with a pretty good amount of translucent setting powder. The powder really, really seems to cling to it though, and I end up with an overly powdered look. This is something I haven't experienced with other foundations. I've experimented with just powdering my t-zone, but when not set, this foundation lifts, and I just don't like the feeling of it.
*Feels heavy. Again, this is due to the sticky feeling. This foundation doesn't feel like skin to me.
*This isn't a good foundation for acne coverage.
*Pricey, but we all know Bobbi's boojie.
*Only moderately oil-controlling.

I don't know. I want to like this foundation, but I just don't like the way it feels. I got it for my wedding day, and maybe I'll use it for that, but I don't think this'll be an everyday foundation.",acne,fair,oily,3,mechanicgirl

Anyway, this foundation is a dream for me and my combo skin.  I usually stay as far away from foundations that are labeled matte because unless I use some super moisturizing illuminating primer under it, it will cling to any texture I have going on, not cute. The claim that this is not a regular matte foundation is what drew me in and that claim rings true. This is one of the first ""matte"" foundations I've ever enjoyed putting on because it does not dry out my skin or emphasize texture like a regular matte foundation. It doesn't sink into my pores OR my smile lines which is extremely rare, especially for the smile lines. It doesn't dry down completely either which means no texture emphasis. The texture is sort of thick and moussey which I don't mind. It also feels a little hydrating too? I love this foundation, it's a new fave for me and I will be buying back up bottles lmao! And can we talk about this shade range? So glad Bobbi Brown didn't compromise this shade range and kept it the same as the regular skin foundation. No shades are missing and all the shades match up in both lines. I am the same shade in both lines which made it remarkably easy for me to find my match, I mean I didn't really have to search at all considering I'm 6.75 in both lines.

This foundation saved my marriage. No longer do I have to waste our housing mortgage money at Sephora buying and trying every foundation. I finally found one that works.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P427430,109,$46.00,3.9908,Skin Long-Wear Weightless Foundation SPF 15,brown,blonde,"I was leaning towards disliking this product at first because its honestly just so sheer. I don't have much of a problem with acne and it covers my redness just fine, but I still wish it had at least a tiny bit more coverage to it. If you have really bad acne or skin problems and you like to cover it mostly or completely, this product is probably not for you. I don't really use concealer because I like my foundation to cover most of what I need it to cover, and since I have little skin problems my past foundations have covered it just fine even if they were thinner. This is the sheerest foundation I've owned. However, it REALLY looks like skin. It does not cling to any dry spots and just has a very natural skin-like finish, so I'd say its worth using a separate concealer on any major spots you'd need heavier coverage from. Another con is that it smells like sunscreen to me. Apparently its supposed to be a light lavender scent. I usually don't care about scent but it just seriously smells like a thick sunscreen. The scent doesn't linger, though, once you've applied it to the skin. I will end with the last pro- It is good for my oily skin. It doesn't hold up as much as a matte foundation would, but even when it starts to break only a bit of shine comes through and actually complements the foundation haha. This is a good foundation for those with oily skin, but still want to enjoy a dewy complexion!",,light,combination,4,asira22

So far, this has done all the above! It isn’t FULL CAKE COVERAGE... but for Bobbi Brown, it most certainly is full coveage! I can get away with a slight spot conceal and then one layer of foundation! Gosh for me putting my makeup on around 6:30am and it staying on until 8pm... this foundation looks beautiful the whole day through! Does have a sunscreen scent... which i personally enjoy having in my foundation... esp if it doesnt get oily!

I initially applied it with an Artis brush, but quickly found my BB to be waaaay more effective as the product is very thick. On my skin it just seemed heavy, like I had a mask on, but I wouldn’t say it looked bad? I don’t know. I felt like my face was going to crack off, and that was prepping with my night cream instead of my lighter moisturizer. I think this foundation would work beautifully for combo and oily skin types. By the end of the day it was breaking up from how dry I was around my T Zone, buuuuut when I went to remove my makeup I was pleased to see it held up all day (except for my weird t zone issue). Staying power 4/5, very medium/high coverage, and I wouldn’t call this natural but I would call it one of the more natural looking matte foundations out there.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P427430,109,$46.00,3.9908,Skin Long-Wear Weightless Foundation SPF 15,green,red,"Sephora didn’t post my first review so trying this again. 

Claims and if accurate or not:
 
Full coverage - this is definitely not a full coverage foundation, it is a true medium (even with 2 pumps)
Oil control - did not control my oils in the t zone 
Weightless - the foundation never really dries and stays very tacky to the touch and feels heavy and tight on the skin for at least 3-4 after application 
Skin like - it does look skin like upon application and very flawless, but breaks down and gets patchy throughout the day (nose sides and chin area)
16 hr wear - I disagree, as the foundation transfers throughout the day and breaks up especially around t zone and nose area
Colour range - really good. Porcelain was a perfect match for me (I am y215 in MUFE)
Non acnegenic - I disagree as this foundation broke me out within days (probably the demithicone)

For reference my skin is combination - normal with oily t zone 
 
Conclusion: I prefer more hydrating formulas that are water based that would balance out my oily t zone. I enjoy a waterproof and transfer proof formula with sheer to medium coverage. I do really appreciate the fact this foundation includes spf 15, however spf 30 would be ideal. 
All in all I will stick to other formulas I like better",acne,fair,combination,2,chabawaba

And most foundations, no matter how matte, do not stop the oils in my skin from coming through after a couple hours. This foundation was no different. Sephora color IQ matched me perfectly and the finished was very nice, matte without looking dry. It does have a very strong smell when applying but it goes away by the time you’re done with your make up (or maybe the smell of my Sweet Peach Blush and Eyeshadow drowned it out).

And even though I went back and added another layer the coverage just wasn’t there. Perhaps I’m used to the fuller coverage foundations.

Solid medium coverage, smooth matte finish, all day flawless wear. This foundation doesn't move! Even when I oil blot, I barely get any oil! It's truly unbelievable. Photographs beautifully, feels comfortable on the skin. Absolutely perfect. I highly recommend this for anyone who has normal to oily skin.

A tip for anyone who gets this; it is really dry / dries up very quickly upon application, if you're like me and prefer to apply foundation with a brush you need to use small amounts and work in sections on your face. Otherwise it will dry out too fast. Maybe it would work better with a damp beauty blender but I found that technique worked best for brush application.",,porcelain,combination,5,dollxoxo

I have always been intrigued by bobbi brown foundations, because the color range is amazing, but there was never a good formula for my combination skin with acne and pores. The finish on this is a bit dewier than I expected. And it feels different than almost every other long-wearing foundation I've used (Kat Von D, Lancome 24 hr., Barepro, Shiseido syncro). It goes on feeling rich and velvety, and it doesn't really dry down and ""set"" on it's own. That did not stop me from loving it!  On my skin, it looks fantastic and it does not settle into fine lines or pores, which is a big issue for me. I set it myself with a powder (but I do that for all foundation) and it really lasts all day. It left my skin looking and feeling extremely natural.

The eye shadow brush is one of my favorites and one that I use every day. It has a small bristled head, but the bristles are fluffy and soft. This brush is the one I use to apply eyeshadow to the lower part of my lid. It’s especially good for getting close to the lashline and the inner corner of my eye. It works great for dabbing a luminizer shadow color at the outer edge of the inside corner or my eye beside the bridge of my nose. It’s compact enough to reach any part of the eye. The handle makes it easy to maneuver and to hold at any angle required to get to those hard to reach areas. It picks up shadow easily and because of the rounded bristles it deposits the eyeshadow without leaving a distinct line so it almost blends the shadow for me leaving me very little blending left to do. This brush does not shed at all. Being an excellent quality brush, it has held up through several cleanings with brush cleaner and some deeper cleanings with mild soap and water, too. I just let it air dry and it dries to its original shape looking brand new. I expect to get years of use out of this brush.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P270584,22,$37.00,4.7273,Eye Sweep Brush,hazel,,"I have had quite a fair amount of eye brushes. But I was in need of a fluffy big brush to blend out the edges. I don't like to invest half of an hour blending, I rather spend most of my make up time on my skincare routine and the application of foundation. Then, my eyebrows consume whatever is left. So, by the time I get to work on my eyeshadow, I really really don't feel like spending ages on it. The thing is that even if you only wear one shade, you gotta blend those edges out or else you will look whacky. So.... Went on the quest and decided to get this brush. Checked few online pictures, read few reviews, and seem fluffy and large. Just what I was in need of. So ordered it.
First, came on a little plastic bag. That was disappointing. Also, seem light in the hand. Even more disappointing. Where was it made at? God knows. Still decided to try it. Applied the shadow using my usual brush, then worked the crease a bit, and finished it all off using this Bobbi Brown brush. Whooooooooooaaaaaah! Amazing. It all got blended out to perfection in a matter of seconds. Truly amazing.
The brush is big, so covers up a huge portion of your eyelid effortlessly. Is quite dense, so when used clean it will blend out whatever. Im guessing you can use it to apply the eyeshadow all over with it, but if your eye lid is small it might not be suitable for you, since is large. Is not as fluffy as I wanted it to be, but Im thinking that the density of it allows it to work both applying a good amount of product, and blending the edges out.
Also has a tapered shape that allows it to do a bit more of detailed work, fitting in the crease horizontally. Yet, don't expect pencil brush precision.
I also used it to blend out the color under the eye perfectly.
Its size probably makes it perfect to contour.
Im super glad I got it. I would like to know where this was made at, though. And for the price tag, the presentation should be better. Still, an amazing brush that makes blending as simple as one, two, three.
I wish I could give this brush a 4 and a half stars. It is soft, doesn't itch, performs great, but the presentation and lack of information do not let me give it a 5. All in all, a great buy though.",,light,,4,CLovesBeauty

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P270575,35,$54.00,3.3429,Face Blender Brush,hazel,,"I purchased two face blender brushes about 6 years ago and have found them to be resilient, long-lasting and well made. Originally I purchased one each for use with two different shimmer bricks. I now use one for bronzer application in the hollow of my cheeks and one for blush/highlighter application. The difference between using this brush for blush and a ""blush brush"" is just control of application. I find this brush spreads the color in a more natural pattern which works well on my round cheeky face and alabaster skin. Brushes that are titled as blush brushes seem to leave too angled and deliberate a swath of color across my cheeks. Some though really want this precise application. I've found; however, this brush suits my needs when it comes to color. They also weather well under cleaning with both a brush cleaner or something more heavy-duty like a soap and water clean. They spring back to form like a champion and over 6 years I've seen very little shedding except immediately after purchase. You will find though that this brush requires some patience and layering because of the fact it doesn't hold a lot of product. I would imagine this is because it is a face ""blender"" brush and if you were using it to blend when finished you wouldn't want it to pick up your hard work and spread it around. Perhaps too this has to do with the intensity of pigment of the products I am using as opposed to the brush. This is preferable to me - better too little to start with than too much.

It's lasted really well and always looked like new (until my neighbor's grandson dropped it, along with some others, into the toilet). I'm so glad to see that these brushes are still available, so I can get another one. The brush is reliable, grasps exactly the right amount of blush, and had another purpose too: brushing it gently over my face for 30 seconds after a stressful day relieves stress and releases facial muscle tension. I've tried that with many other brushes and I've only had one other brush that came close, but wasn't quite as good. There's something about this specific brush that felt good. I told a friend about it, and she tried it with her BB Face Blender Brush (which she's had ""forever"") and concurred.

I take really good care of my brushes, cleaning them each time I use them. That brush looked brand new for years. I'm sure it would have lasted for years longer, too, until it came to its unfortunate and untimely demise due to my neighbor's six year old grandson.

In addition to the shedding, the brush SMELLS (which does not go away upon washing). The scent of glue is so overpowering that I can't even use it until it is a last resort.

The Uber Red is a ridiculous, bold, perfect red.Full coverage, creamy and looks great after eating. Stays bright and vibrant for me.
English Rose is a deep nude. It doesn't blend in with your lip color, but stands out without looking bold. A great neutral but a great deep/darker neutral. It goes on deeper than the color in the tube.
The packaging - woah. these are squeeze tubes of lipstick. They aren't liquid but aren't a full on thick lipstick either, somewhere right in between. it's a little daunting the first time you go to put it on because of the squeezing action, but get a little out and smooth it on (you'll want to prep with a lip liner first, even on the rose color). I might even suggest putting it on with a lip brush for maximum control. Also, you really have to squeeze to get the product out. I noticed that it dries down but not fully. First I didn't like that, then I realized that the formula is really moisturizing and doesn't feel tight, dry or flaky on my lips.
The only two cons I have is 1) the packaging, I'm afraid that if it was really squished in my bag, a lot of product would be lost! and 2) I need more minis of other colors!

But it's a great way to check out the formula and see if you like it before investing in a full size (individual full sized ones are much bigger than the ones included in this set). The shades that come in this set are beautiful shades which would look good on a lot of different skin tones - English rose: which is like a pinky mauveish color and Uber Red: which is a fuchsia red. 
This formula reminds me a little of the nars velvet lip glides except the consistency is a little thicker and I believe it lasts longer on the lips. It is not  transfer proof but it does stain the lips beautifully. 
The packaging - it comes in a small squeezy tube and the tip is small and made of the same plastic so it's not very comfortable on the lips and I find it difficult to apply straight from the tube (because it is so tiny and my lips are a little big) it goes on very patchy straight from the tube so I use a lip brush to overcome that little problem. I do foresee having trouble getting the product out once it is about halfway through - it'll be like trying to squeeze out the very last bit of toothpaste.

But the beauty consultant there applied this lotion before applying the BB cream. I was so deliciously amazed by the feeling of this lotion that I asked the consultant what she had put on my face. She showed me this lotion, and I ended up buying this instead of the BB cream.

This lotion doesn't instantly absorb into your skin but because it's not a superlight moisturizer you can really feel your skin eating it up. The smell is really really Divine! It's not an artificial disgusting perfumey smell, but it's very natural, heavenly, fresh, and just perfect! Your skin feels very soft afterwards and will thank you.

I have been using this lotion for over a month alternating with other moisturizers I have from Sisley and La Mer. The price is definitely not low but even compared to moisturizers that are over a hundred dollars, this really outperforms them.

I sometimes use a toner and sometimes not with this lotion, I don't think that part matters, but make sure you cleanse your skin well to reap all the benefits. I use about one and a half pump for my entire face and neck.

This particular product has not been reformulated, nothing has been removed. It simply does not meet the current regulations for SPF put forth by the FDA (therefor no longer able to advertise that it has SPF) and Bobbi, being the perfectionist that she is, did not want to reformulate.

It’s rather loosely packed and long so when you tap of the powder it really leaves only a small amount on the brush to prevent over-powdering.

Everyone raves about setting sprays and mists, but I just never found one thats worth the money and results. Until Bobbi Brown.

I swear my pores look smaller, make up lasts longer and it just makes my skin look almost flawless (with all its flaws and there are sooooooooo many.)

It layers well, looks great with other shades of shadow, and doesn't crease or fade. (I used a primer). My friend also included an empty palette so that I can put three Bobbi Brown shadows inside.

If you're looking for a very pigmented eyeshadow, this may not be for you, but if you're looking for a beautiful, light wash of colour (i.e. a shimmer wash) then you won't be disappointed.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P270569,107,$26.00,4.4486,Shimmer Wash Eye Shadow,brown,,"Frankly, I was skeptical about a shimmery shadow. I'm approaching 40 and the last thing I want is to look shimmery or glittery and draw attention to the fact that my lids aren't as smooth and youthful as they were when I was 20.

But I'm SO glad I gave this a go. It really isn't shimmery at all, it's got a subtle sheen to it which actually is more flattering than a completely flat colored shadow. My pick was Fawn and I think it's the best neutral colored shadow out there, for several reasons. First, it's one of those rare colors that really does look good on everyone. It's not beige and it's not brown and it's not purple. On fair skin like mine, it's almost smokey but NEVER looks muddy - something I detest in a shadow. I can imagine on darker skin tones it's really lovely and the sheen effect would be just as pronounced.

The other reason I love this is that it can be used to create a smokey eye look by itself and a dark eggplant liner or it works very well to just add a clean sweep of color for a daytime look.

Finally, it's the most budge-proof powder I've ever used on my eyes. It's literally in the same place, hours later and it doesn't crease at all. I don't have oily lids, but I've never had a shadow that doesn't crease up towards the end of the day.

I would highly recommend this shadow, particularly in this color to anyone of any age or skin tone. If you're looking to play up brown or hazel eyes, you can't go wrong with this color and a swipe of the Black Plum gel liner.",,light,,5,sbsunshine

Problem: It looks as if I have done nothing at all to my eyes. A natural look is fine, but no need to spend $22 for a natural look. Perhaps the darker colors do well with bridal make up. For a sheer wash, I can take many of my over the top shadows, dilute in water on back of my hand, and then sheer them and get more effect than I do with this. This is the ""Emperor has no clothing"" to me, pay alot of money and wear nothing. I had expected more of BB.

Preparing your skin prior to makeup makes the WORLDS difference as to how your makeup will lay on the face and stay on.
This primer is a fantastic base for all mediums of foundations. I have used this with liquid, stick, cream, and powder foundations and it performs beautifully on all.
I have oily/combination skin but more on the oily side and when its really bad, I'm extra oily then have dry patches in random spots.
I put a decent size amount of this on my fingers and smooth it over my whole face. You'll instantly see how it almost puts a layer down of barrier and diminishes pores and lines. I let it settle 2-5 minutes before I continue with the rest of my application.
Your foundation will glide on so nicely and wont have a problem with blending. Your makeup will look so smooth and will really last all day long. I work 13 hour days and this has helped my make up looking fresh all day.
I love all Bobbie Brown products and this one is one of her best yet! Along with her stick foundations which I finish with her Sheer Finish Powder in Pale Yellow. (another holy grail and stays in my kit)

If you are wondering why i even keep trying with this brand, its because i used a promo code to get a mini of this for free.  Waste of a promo code lol!!! Now, as far as the actual product goes, this is worse than useless.  Its not a primer as far as i can tell, and actually exacerbates the look of pores by causing foundation (in my case Marc Jacobs or Nars)  to not lay right and cause your pores to look like polka dots.  It seriously looks like dots, as it causes the foundation to sit in pores oddly.  I do not experience this normally!  If you are interested in a Bobbi Brown non-primer skin prep/base product,  i would suggest you try the Vitamin Enriched Face Base,  which is actually the only Bobbi product  i enjoy.  This product here, actually makes my pores and makeup in general, look much worse, and yes, i have tried it on multiple occasions to be sure.   Its a shame.

Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing blush, goes on great and creamy and dries to a natural looking flush, not powdery or greasy. It's far superior in that way to most blushes.

But when I have tried to use it as lip color, well....not so great. It's drying on my lips and it does look a bit cakey and obvious even when applied with a very light touch with the fingers.

I adore Bobbi products, but let's face it, it's hard to formulate a perfect texture for both lip and cheek color.

I also find that most blush/lip color combos can be hit and miss even aside from the formula.is that the colors that we wear on our cheeks aren't always flattering as lip colors. For instance, I can wear a coral color great on my cheeks but when applied to my lips, my complexion looks a bit odd.

And the lasting power is crazy! I have pretty oily skin, so by the end of the day my makeup seems to have melted off of me, but this kind of dries down and stays put for 12+ hours.

I have Petal Pink and Cabo Coral and I think both are flattering and easy for almost anyone to wear.

The only reason it doesn't get five stars from me is that it really isn't a multi-tasker. Frankly, as great as the color is on the cheeks, it is waxy and chalky (at the same time, I'm not sure how!) on the lips and tends to highlight any kind of line or dryness in the lips. Trying it over a lip pencil didn't work either, and with gloss or balm made it just worse. None of these colors can be worn on the lids, so that just leaves the cheeks.

And don't get me wrong, it's possibly the best cream blush I've ever used and I'll continue to buy it for that. But I don't think it works as a multi tasking color.",,light,,4,sbsunshine

I was looking for something that wasn't sparkly, metallic, or obvious; I was looking for polished and refined. I had been using Guerlain Meteorites (in the can) for 15 years (!) and wanted a change. Apparently, Guerlain changed their Meteorites shading from the time I started using it; it just doesn't wear on me shade-wise as well as it used to. Also, as my skin has gotten more mature, the Meteorites started to look more obvious with a glittery-yet-powdery effect. Even though I'm a loyal Bobbi Brown makeup wearer (face and eyes), I put off trying this powder because I didn't want to spend what I feel is too much money on just a compact. Well, I tried the Brightening Nudes and loved it so much that I rationalized (ha!) my way into it and the Bronze for summer. This powder over the Sheer Pressed Powder in Pale Yellow and BB cream in Light provides such a natural look. At first, I thought the powder wasn't doing anything, and then I realized that I was so used to ""heavier,"" more powdery and sparkly look, I had lost perspective of what a finishing powder really should look like on me. I'll be honest, this Bobbi Brown powder isn't as near as good a value as the Meteorites (a can of that, although the price has increased to $60, will likely outlive you). But this finishing powder still lasts a good long time. I also like that it's less obvious than the Meteorites and other powders I've tried, not at all drying like some powders can be, very light on the skin, more portable (a can of Meteorites was horrible for travel).

I tried reapplying the next time with a different brush and a lighter hand. It just was a chalky mess again.

With so many great illuminating and perfecting powders on the market, even in this very line, there should be no reason you can't find a better formula out there.

I love the ability to play around with sections to go from cool to warm and nude or dark. I use it to brighten up darker shadows on my cheekbones or just to not look tired if I have not slept enough. I use a kabuki brush for a natural glow finish. Works like a charm.,,medium,combination,5,Aarwen

And let me just tell you; I woke up with soft, plum skin, and my pimples smaller. This mask is a little strange, since it is more of a cream you put on and then wipe off without water, but I am so glad I found it. This is for sure a new staple in my beauty bag!",,,,5,eraymond

It's called a mask but it really absorbs into your skin and doesn't sit on top or anything like that. My skin is very dry (due to environmental and other factors, and so dry to the point of being flaky!) and I've found that this mask restores moisture without irritating my skin or aggravating my acne. I was a little worried it wouldn't be moisurizing enough to correct the flakiness because it's described as being 'lightweight,' but it worked beautifully for me. The mask is the perfect consistency.

This tube soap is the facial cleanser that I use when I’m in the shower because of the convenient tube dispenser that sits upside down so that the cleanser is always ready to come out and because it seals tight so that water splashed around in the shower can’t get inside the tube. (I use Clinique’s “Acne Solutions Foaming Face Wash” when I wash my face in the sink.) I love the way this cleanser lathers up and it only takes a pea-sized amount to get lots of lather and to cleanse my whole face so a tube lasts for months since I only use it once a day. It has a nice pleasant very light aroma. I have very oily and sensitive skin and this cleanser works great at lifting the dirt, oil and bacteria out of my pores and leaving my skin feeling soft and clean. It rinses easily without leaving any residue behind. This cleanser works with the Clarisonic face brush, too, but since I use it in the shower I seldom take my Clarisonic brush in the shower with me.

I have combination skin, where my cheeks are normal/dry and my T-zone is normal/oily, and this toner definitely makes me feel moisturized and clean, like what the description says. Other than hydrating and moisturizing, it doesn't seem to do much else. My occasional acne is still occasional, and I don't see my pores getting any smaller. But this toner never said it would cure any of those, so I'm not disappointed.

During the summer, I don't even need to put on moisturizer because this is moisturizing enough, but I do put on sunscreen if I'm going out because this obviously has no SPF.

The cons: OH MY GOSH THE SMELL. I am not sensitive to smells but this smells so strongly of patchouli that its quite off-putting. It's so strong that anyone standing next to me or even a few feet away could smell it potently. Another big issue for me is the packaging. There's no dropper, just a hole you're supposed to cover with your finger and then flip the bottle over to pick up oil. Not only is this inconvenient, it is NOT travel friendly and it is soooo easy to spill. I don't want to spend almost $70 on something I'm going to lose a lot of.

I've read in some reviews that others find it is great for both work and for evening occasions. Honestly I find it to be far too glittery to be appropriate for work. I really only wear it going out with friends. I find it to be glittery enough to add some extra dimension and light to your look without being so over the top that it becomes distracting. A perfect balance in my opinion.

The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it can be a little messy in application as fine glitter gets everywhere. My recommendation would be to press it on rather to sweep it on in order to avoid such a mess.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P382069,56,$36.00,3.9107,Sparkle Eye Shadow,brown,,"I am in my 50s and I thought I would never wear glitter eyeshadow again. I had gradually switched to all matte shadows because iridescent, shimmer, or metallic shadows highlight every last bit of wrinkling and loss of firmness on my eyelids. The effect was very aging and unflattering.

But how I missed pretty, glittery, eye makeup! And now I am thrilled to have found the Bobbi Brown Sparkle Eyeshadow. I bought it in ballet pink. It does not leave an opaque, heavy layer over the lid. Instead the base is very sheer - almost transparent - and I just see very tiny specks of micro glitter on my eyelid. I pat it on sparingly, and it is a subtle, grownup effect. It isn't garish or harsh. And it works so well on my no-longer young eyelids! I can't believe I can wear sparkle eyeshadow again.

I liked it so much that I also bought silver moon. It is similar: a transparent base with very, very fine, subtle silver glitter.

If you are looking for a dense, bright, shimmering wash of color, you may be disappointed. But for me, this is the best product I have found all year. I wear it over matte shadow. For example, I cover the eye area with BB Shell. Then I use BB Ivory under my eyebrows as a subtle, matte highlight. Then I press a tiny amount of the ballet pink over my lids and upper eye area. Very subtle and pretty.

What it produces is a beautiful, sheer wash of glittery goodness, and you can definitely tell it's golden based. My favorite way of applying it is to put a layer on with a damp brush, then go over it again by pressing it on with a dry brush. You can apply this on top of any color shadow, and it only makes your eyes prettier. I have not experienced any fallout with this product, which continues to surprise me. The glitter is subtle--not obnoxious at all. It's very fine, and when the light catches it, the sparkle is magnificent. Bonus--I think it makes my eyelids look smoother than they actually are.

I applied it thinking it was a normal cream, but it is most definitely a balm/salve. You must rub and warm this between your fingers before applying it for an even distribution of product.
It does remains tacky once applied, and instantly made me think that it would make a great primer. I did check the Bobby Brown website to see if this could also be used as a foundation base, and once confirmed, I did not hesitate to test it out as such.

I must say that it worked out fantastic. My skin looked so smooth and soft, even with the 20 layers of foundation and powder I regularly apply, and my foundation did not budge all day.

I have been using it now for the past few days as the last step in my skin care routine, and as the first in my make up application.

This has been my go to routine the past week:
1. On clean, dry, exfoliated skin- I apply my eye cream and the new bareMinerals Serum, and then follow it up with a layer of Josie Maran's argan milk.
2. After letting the products sink in for about 3-5 minutes, I then going with the moisturizing balm. I rub a small button sized amount of the balm between my fingers and dot the product on my forehead and cheeks. I then start to distribute it to my entire face by alternating swiping in putting it into the skin, and will then follow up with smaller amounts to any areas I feel product is sparse
3. Once the balm has been distributed evenly and feels tacky,I go in and DAB on my foundation- either with a beautyblender or a flat top kabuki brush.
*since the balm is very stick, if using a brush, I will lightly mist either my face or the the brush with a primer spray (usually Skindinavia's primer spray or Smashbox's primer water) to avoid any patchiness from the bristles tugging.

The only thing I find is it starts to bother me after a long day (put in on early morning, go out for the evening), and then I will touch my eyes and it will start to flake. I think it's because it's a pretty thick formula and starts to get dry and lift after a long time. I keep it for special occasions rather than every day, for this reason.",,fair,,4,crazyworkinmom
Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P413402,20,$37.00,4.1,Long-Wear Liquid Liner,green,,"For reference, I have two shades - bronze sparkle and violet sparkle. 

I will say that all of the shades in this range are subtle in the sense that they all have a fairly deep base to them, so once they are on the eyes, it's not an in-your-face colour situation. I think this is a good thing but for some shades it's a disadvantage. For instance, Violet Sparkle is almost TOO deep that it's borderline black, so the 'violet/purple' aspect kind of gets lost. 

Bronze sparkle on the other hand is SOOO beautiful. Again, it's a very deep shade but I think the brown/bronze tones come out more, and it has these beautiful micro gold glitters that I love. I think this shade would look great on most people!

In terms of application, I wouldn't say it's not the easiest to use but it's not too bad - it takes a little practice and getting used to. It's not the most beginner friendly liquid liner. Also, make sure to SHAKE the heck out of these before each use, and also give them a shake every now and then if you aren't using them often. I find that it helps keep the product from getting clumpy and weird over time. 

Price point is quite high... Considering you can get some very good liners at Sephora for approx. $25 (CAD), the price point of $42 seems fairly steep. However it's sort of a speciality liner, because of the 'multidimensional, high-shimmer' finish... If you had to pick just one to buy, I can safely say most people will love Bronze Sparkle - it's a nice change from a plain black liner, without being too out there. 

Just a final note, whenever I wear liquid liner (most days) I always use an eye shadow primer (NARS Pro Prime) and set that with a base shadow, so I have no issues with this flaking, fading or smudging.",,fair,,4,torontogirl23

I've spent the last few days trying all the products that came in the collection. There were a total of four eye shadows, including a Metallic Eye Shadow in Navajo. Coincidentally, I just bought Velvet Plum last week. Both shades are excellent. While I prefer Velvet Plum (reviewed separately last week) wet, I prefer Navajo dry. Navajo is a pale white with pink undertones, which can be used as shadow, or highlighter (eyes and elsewhere). It blends well, and although I prefer it dry because it looks softer, when used wet it dries to a really nice finish. I'm really pleased with this gift of Navajo, and glad that I bought Velvet Plum.

(My friend also included an empty palette so that I can put three Bobbi Brown shadows inside. I'm happy that manufacturers are now giving customers the option to create their own palettes, since I've been depotting and repotting my shadows for years, creating my own palettes.

When I looked at the shade in the store, I discovered that it was much better in actuality than it looked in the swatches. I realized that in addition to using this shade to create the style I saw illustrated, I could get a lot of use out of it in other ways. I'm using this wet as liner, and as shadow, both wet and dry.

I am olive-skinned with more purplish circles way far down my eyes almost to my cheek, so I grabbed the Medium stick, which has a nice warm hue that color-corrected me.

I applied a bit under my eyes (that were STILL dark after applying my old concealers) and checked how it looked in every mirror/ lighting in the store. I was really pleased.
I used this stick this morning in my full makeup routine and am just as happy with how it looks as really my only concealer and in the natural/ office light!

My biggest problem with the pencil is that you have to ""warm it up"" on your hand before applying it - which is wasteful in my opinion. I would not recommend apply the stick straight to the skin - not only for hygiene reasons- but because it's a bit hard and drags the skin. I especially don't think people should do this on their under eye area (use the stick straight on the skin). Maybe a quick swipe over a blemish but even then it's unsanitary and pulls the skin.

There is no applicator on this lipstick. When you squeeze it, it comes out a little hole in the slanted tip. It can get messy and its difficult to apply unless you use a lip brush, swipe the product off the tip and apply with brush.

All of the colours in this line are VERY pigmented -- but they are DARK pigments, meaning every single colour is bold. There are no understated pinks or nudes in this line. Everything is bright and dark.

Because this is NOT a matte lipstick, it does not dry down. It will stay wet looking unless you blot it off -- and it is NOT a lip stain, so blotting it WILL remove the lipstick from your lips. It will wipe off completely.

Its oily, not-quite-liquid consistency means that it WILL move and smudge, it WILL stick to things, and it WILL come off. It will NOT stay in place for long.

Honestly there are better lipsticks out there. If you want a liquid, get a liquid. If you want a solid, get a solid. At least with those, you won't be looking at wasting product. The ends of the tube are both hard, and no applicator means there will be wasted product in the bottom as it empties.",,light,,1,Mechart

The only downfall is the packaging. It would be better if the bottom was twistable and then you can twist up how much product you want.
I think this product would be best applied with a lip brush just because it can be hard to gauge how much product you're going to squeeze and the applicator isn't all that great.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P416008,115,$29.00,3.687,Art Stick Liquid Lip,hazel,,"I have tried different long lasting lipsticks for years and they were awful and always very drying. This was a promo product on the site, so I said why not. I have very dry lips, I literally have lip balm by my bed, in my car, and in my makeup bag, but the formula of this one is fantastic. I did not reapply for about 7 hours and had a something to eat. The color did fade a little after that, but I did not reapply,
and did not have to use any lip balm all day. The color I received says English Rose, described as a medium pink. It is actually a pretty dark wine color, a big change for me since I am a Nats Dolce Vita pencil girl, but I actually liked trying something out of my comfort zone, and will wear it at night. When you get the product, it looks like you should twist up from the bottom to get the product out. There are many cosmetics with this packaging, like YSL Touché Eclat. You have to twist about 10 times to get those products to the top, so I did this and the bottom fell off and when I squeezed, it started coming out of both ends. I tried gluing the bottom back on to no avail. Also, the applicator is just a slanted top with a hole in the middle where the product comes out. I have not used a lip brush in years and can apply most lipsticks without even looking in the mirror, but you will need a lip brush for this one (again, they should have made the applicator a brush), I went into the store to look at the full size, and there is no info anywhere saying this is a squeeze tube, except on the description by the product on the site, but still, it should be on or in the packaging and the product itself. A lot of people don't read the small type in the description near the end on line, but I always look on the packaging for instructions. It is incomprehensible how this made it through all the research and development, meetings, etc...that large companies put their products through. Whoever made the final decision to approve the application of the product  should be fired. I am so hopeful that they redesign the packaging because the product itself is so fantastic!! Also, there is a lot of product wasted in squeezable tubes. I would hate to see it be discontinued for lack of sales.

With that being said the packaging came with zero instructions on how to apply. So I assumed it was a twist at the bottom. Well that broke the bottom black piece off which is literally there for decoration and no purpose at all. Since I thought this was a twist and twisted the black piece off the bottom it created a tiny hole so that when I actually pushed the product out of the plastic tube it came out of the bottom and a lot quicker than it came out of the top. When I finally got the lipstick on I loved the color so much that I was pretty upset I had just broke the sample. The pigment is wonderful on the English Rose, and it's nice and creamy.

The formula is not like the ubiquitous liquid lipsticks on the market--this one has a mousse-like texture. It dries to a matte finish though. And, unlike the more fluid liquid lipsticks, it doesn't just sit on top of your lips looking like an opaque layer of paint. This product's slight emollience means it's more comfortable to wear and provides a more natural coverage. It's not completely budge-proof though. However, that's a trade-off I'm willing to accept. 

I've seen other reviews complaining about the applicator. It's definitely odd, but quick to master. I squeeze out some product and apply it to the center of my lip and then use the plastic tip to push the product around to cover my lips.

Now the bad, the sample I just used my finger to apply but the full size you squeeze and it comes out the tip and I hate it.

Whenever I use this either as the finishing step in my skincare routine to give me a boost or as the main show, my skin feels amazing. It's just so nice. And a jar will last you forever and a day.

This pencil is easy to apply and and the soft tip glides right on. The line comes out a bit thicker vs the gel liner with a brush, but the color is super rich and great for a more dramatic look. I also love how easy it is to build it up for a night look as well!

I do not line all the way to the outer corner otherwise I get transfer. Your eyelids might be different though! If I need a fancier look for a night out, I will also use it on my bottom waterline - super smoky sexy look.

This liner has had the absolute BEST hold of any liner I have tried - and I have tried many, including UD 24/7, Stila Smudge Stick, Bobbi gel pot, Chanel, Kat von D.

The formula is long-lasting, even on the lower lash-line. There are two problems with this. This first problem is the price. It's too expensive in my opinion. This feels like a pencil worth around $16-18. The second problem is that this cannot be smudged at all. So if you like that soft & smoky look, you are going to have to find another product to acheive it. This does not budge at all.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P309704,126,$27.00,3.8095,Long-Wear Eye Pencil,gray,,"I'm actually surprised by the reviews saying that it smudges so much--while I do get very minor smudging at the end of the day (as I do with EVERY liner) this is the longest wearing eyeliner--especially on waterline--that I've EVER USED.  I suppose much of it depends on each individual's body chemistry, though.  

Seriously, I have tried so many different liners, including MJ's Highliner that is said to have the best lasting power, and this one is the only one that has stayed perfectly put in my waterline for more than 6 hours on me.  It glides on smoothly and darkly (I use the black), and stays put. 

My eyes water a lot, and while I do get some very slight smudging at the corners of my eyes later in the day (again, this happens on me with all liners, no matter what), I still have tons of product left in the waterline.  That's what makes it exceptional to me.  Not that it's completely smudgeproof but, that of all liners out there, this is the only one that I don't have to worry about the pigment disappearing through the course of the day, in spite of minor smudging. I can tidy up any smudges, and my liner will still look perfect and freshly applied.  

If I'm doomed to deal with some smudging regardless of eyeliner, I'd rather use the one that I know will still be there and doesn't have to be reapplied, or worse, looks patchy and faded.",,fair,,5,Ilos

Now the brush... I mean I know it's a travel so the tweezers/brush don't feel quality. But they spent the time to brand the brush with mini ""Bobbi Brown"" printed on it and signature style... but why did they put these cheap bristles on. legit feels like cheap car snow scraper brush material.  The tweezers have no bounce back in them... and honestly I expected more. For half the price you can get similar tools in a mini brow kit from another brand.. or better! I obvs have my own tools I will use, but at this price mark I expect better quality or don't even try to deliver this if you can't. I would much rather pay the same price for just the powder but get rid of these jokes of tools and make more room for the actual product I'm paying for.

Bobbi Brown,Fragrance,P387969,148,$28.00,3.9122,Beach Rollerball,,,"Completely agree with previous reviewer. I'm not sure this is a fragrance you'd wear to work or as an everyday scent. I purchased the Beach Rollerball and unlike some, I LOVE the smell of sunblock. I live in California..in the Central Valley..and it's been 100 degrees all week. Coppertone (and generic brands) are a staple in my house, as we swim morning to evening. My UPS just delivered my package as I'm cooking dinner but I had to try it ASAP!  I rolled some on in the kitchen and within minutes, one of my boys said, ""Mom! I smell sunblock!"" I DO love the scent. I imagine wearing this on days we go boating, to the beach for the day, maybe bbqing with friends...but as a 40 year old woman (not sure if 20 year olds think differently lol) I don't want to smell like Coppertone 24/7. If you are on the fence with this fragrance, buy yourself a bottle of Coppertone at Target, spray it all over, and if you love it...you'll love this. 
I own the full size of Replica Beach Walk...and let me tell you...BOMB! I can't explain the smell...its beachy but not sunblocky...it's soooooo sexy. Everyone who comes near me, man or woman, says I smell so good. That's my everyday scent along with a little spritz of LaVanila Coconut. I've worn LaVanila for over 10 years and it attracts every man in sight, young and old! 
Bottom line: I'm happy with this Beach rollerball purchase. Would I purchase again? Maybe. But not in full size.",,,,4,girlyboymom

Other reviews said that it didn't last long on them but on me it lasts all day and doesn't fade or change throughout the day. I really like it because I like the smell of sunscreen, but I think this might be a bit too literal for a lot of people.

Yes, I can smell how people are getting notes of bug spray but I think its the oh-so-light hint of citron that is influencing their memory to make them think of citronella oil.  The wear is very light, as other reviewers stated. If you live in a very hot, sunny environment where the humidity is over 70% on any given day you want to avoid heavy, cloying scents and this definitely functions well for that.

My skin is bone dry in the winter (I live in Florida and used to humidity most of the year), but this kept my skin looking fresh and not wrinkled.

Wow how much better my skin is since using this moisturizer. My skin stays hydrated all day long. My skin dosen't get tight and itchy at the end of the day. My skin glows. My makeup applies more smoothly and evenly. It is so nice now that it is now formulated with anti-aging ingredients. They just took a fantastic product and made it better. I also use the one without SPF at night as it is heavier and more hydrating. All I can say is that this moisturizer gets used up and dosen't end up in my enormous collection of products that I hate or that don't work. I won't use any other moisturizer. This is definately not for someone who has oily skin. It is truly made for those who live in drier climates and have very dry skin. I thought I would wear this only in the winter when it is super dry, but I wear it year round. I don't apply it like a regular moisturizer.

I decided to give this one a try based on the reviews and since it looks like a similar consistency as the Philosophy. I also hoped it wouldn't sting as well and possibly be more effective. I got my wish! No eye lashes lost and all my eye makeup came off more quickly. Just let the product on your cotton swab/pad sit on your eye for 15 seconds or so first and then begin to gently wipe.

Tip: the opening of the bottle is perfectly sized for dipping a Q-tip inside! You can use very minimal product this way, as opposed to using a cotton pad. Just dip one end of the Q-tip in, clean one eye, then dip the other end in and clean the other eye. No double-dipping, no mess, no waste.

This is perfect for me for daily use. I would say this is a buildable medium coverage, as it did not cover my freckles nor my dark spots. I adore the texture and the packaging makes it super easy to transport with me in my purse or gym bag. I started at the center of my face and blended outward. 

The finish is natural, just a better version of your skin. The texture is light and airy, dries to a soft finish on your skin. I definitely think you need a finishing powder to set, it's a little tacky, not sticky, when it dries. It didn't crease or crack or settle into my wee lines. 

I also use this on nights out with my foundation. It gives me just a little more coverage and flawless looking skin.

A great purchase! A great Multi-tasking product. It's a winner for me. My color is light medium. I'm Korean with dark brown hair and freckles, temperamental skin, acne prone, rosacea, mid 30s.

As someone who's been battling dark circles since the teenage years - maybe even pre-teen - I've spent a long time looking for the perfect under-eye concealer. (Not under-eye cream, of course, because who can be bothered?)

When I've tried Bobbi's under-eye concealers in the past, they always felt a little thick and drying. A bit too stage makeup-y for every day, y'know? Then I hopped on the Touche Eclat bandwagon, and it was okay. Turns out it's a highlighter, not a concealer... my bad. Next up was Nars, usually with a layer of YSL on top. Again, a little thick.

So my understanding with this one is that it's meant to go under a concealer, and you can do that. I've tried it under Nars and the effect is nice, full coverage, etc. But honestly, this is great on its own. Unless you're going full face for a big event, a swipe of this under each eye is all you need.

I was so excited to try the serum, because lately I've been all about serum everything. With the regular corrector,the formula is thick and creamy and doesn't crease. The serum however, is a nightmare. It's liquidy and way too runny. Pretty much slid off of my skin right after I applied, there was no correction at all. It made my concealer crease and look washed out, which is not cute when you have dark undereye circles like I do. The color is also way darker than the pan.

Concealers never seem to be able to get the job done, because my problem is mostly color- the blueish purple always comes through, no matter the strength of the concealer. That's when I decided I need a color corrector, and tried the Urban decay 'naked' corrector. I gave it a week, and it just did not do much, and actually made my concealer look worse. I returned it, and bought this at the recommendation of a sephora employee. I am so thrilled i did because it's life-changing! I first use my first aid beauty 4 in 1 eye cream, then the Bobbi Brown serum corrector, then either the nars or make-up forever concealer. Since this corrector is a serum, it helps to hydrate the underage area which is great considering the Nars concealer alone can be drying.

Absolutely! I am a fan of the Becca corrector, too, but I use this one all the time as well. The corrector preps and ""neutralizes"" the discoloration of shadows and circles so that your concealer can do a better job. I don't think this is as effective on its own. The shade swatches online are definitely not true to the actual color. Go to Sephora or a Bobbi Brown counter to make sure you get a true match to your skin color. The shades are also tinted to address the different tones of shadows (some circles are bluish, some are purple, and some are more brown).

I can't say this is the best ever but I can say this concealer really does work on creating the perfect base of correcting the discolouration so when you put on the skin colour concealer on top(I use the nars one), they work perfectly and doesn't crease because the Bobbi brown corrector is so lightweight yet it mostly corrects the darkness. I recommend this as a base for colour correction. When you put this on, make sure you let it sit for a while (1 minute or so, you can do your brows at that time) and blend it a little then after put a creamy liquid concealer (the nars one works perfectly with Bobbi brown serum) on only the darkness part(usually it is the bottom of the dark circle not the puffy part) and the slowly blend the top concealer with a makeup sponge (I recommend) and make sure you blend the concealer upwards so it doesn't heavy highlights the puffiness but just enough amount to further correct the darkness of the dark circles.

You let it stay on your under eye in a triangle form for at least 30 seconds to a minute to warm and then spread it evenly.

Bobbi Brown,Skincare,P387642,55,$46.00,4.1818,Soothing Cleansing Oil,,,"Well, I must say I'm both surprised this product isn’t more popular and by some of the negative reviews here. I too discovered this cleanser early 2016 from a 500 point perk. I quickly fell in love with this product from the sample size. I committed to purchasing the full size once my previous makeup removing oil cleanser finished. 

My skin: Oily / combination. Riddled with acne through early 20s. Deep pores, many of which are fully dilated/opened. My oiliness usually bleeds through my makeup within 2 hrs, I have to regularly blot throughout the day with sheets and reapplication of setting powders. Over active sebum + living in dirty air NYC my pores are regularly and easily congested causing builds and occasion breakouts even with a sound AM/PM routine.

How I've used it: nickel – quarter sized amount smothered and massaged into my skin to remove light/medium coverage face makeup and full eyelid makeup (primer, etc).

Pros: A little really does go a long way. Fragrance is uplifting, soothing and refreshing – perfect spa aroma to wash off the day and reset myself for my evening/sleep. No residue oil after rinsing (whether my sebum, or from the product). Skin feels as though it’s drinking in fresh air once I pat dry. Truly feels like the beginning of a spa treatment. Even my skin toner cottonball from my toner is clean after use (when not using waterproof makeup).

Cons: If you do NOT have oily or combination skin, I get how some clients may find this product may too drying. It’s not as effective on waterproof mascara/eye liner and high pigment matte lipstick (too faced w/ no primer), but it’s not a deal breaker. Price – the larger size does make the unit price per ounce easier to swallow, but I couldn’t tell my partner I just spent 66 USD on a product to remove makeup.

2-week results: without changing anything else in my regiment, my skin in the AM is more vibrant, balanced, softer, moisturized – I attribute this to having an even cleaner canvas to start my PM treatment routines.

I really love this product – does EAXCTLY what I need my makeup removing cleanser to do",,,oily,5,ilovecake

While I do think keeping a routine has helped my skin, I do owe a lot of its well being to this cleansing oil.

I use it as a regular day to day ""cleanser"", but it is effective at removing extra buildup from makeup or sweat. Simply apply to a dry face and rinse with water... You will literally see your makeup dissolving from the product before wetting the skin!

My face always feels clean and soft after washing, and neither too oily nor dry.

I usually purchase the 6.7 oz bottle, and I'd say it can last me upwards of 6-8 months. I probably have only repurchased it maybe 5 times max over the past 4 years.

The bottle itself is outstanding and just what I wanted. It's a one-ounce bottle and it is refillable. It's a hard plastic container with a pump (pumps work better for oil cleansers because they don't leak). The pump dispenses a small amount, so if you want to use little or a lot, you can get the amount you want. There is a small cover that goes over the top of the pump so that the pump can't accidentally be pressed while it's packed. Again - - - just what I wanted.

The cleanser itself works well. It's neither too thick nor too thin or runny. Applied with dry hands to a dry face, it removes all my makeup, including long-wear and waterproof eye makeup. When water is added it emulsifies and rinses away easily with no oily residue at all.

I wish I could give this 5 stars, but I'm deducting a star because of the smell of the cleanser. I can't put my finger on anything specific to describe the smell/fragrance of this. It does not smell pleasant to me. It's not strong, but it goes right onto the face, so it's noticeable. It's not so bad that I'm going to pour it out, but I'm not going to buy the full size bottle.

However, there aren't lots of beneficial ingredients or anything lasting about this cleanser, other than not stripping the skin.

But I thought an oil cleanser would be safe to try, so I took a chance. Am I ever glad that I did! With just a few uses, my skin feels softer and clearer than ever.

The secret is to take your time - use a generous amount, rub between your palms to warm it, then apply all over and massage with your fingertips. Add warm water a little at a time and keep massaging to emulsify the oil and repeat until you've rinsed it all away.

It also makes the blush look blended so that it looks very natural—I can’t tell where my blush begins and ends which is exactly the way blush is supposed to look. It does most of the work for me. It has held up well through several quick cleanings with a brush cleaner, plus a couple of deeper cleanings with a mild soap and water.

About the second week or so I started to notice how even and smooth my skin looked. I use to always have tiny tiny pimples on my chin and forhead/hairline and since using this, they have pretty much vanished.

Now, currently, I have noticed that the serum continues to maintain everything it has done so far, and more! My skin is much more plump, radiant, bright, smooth, and youthful.

Bobbi Brown,Skincare,P270591,48,$75.00,4.1458,Intensive Skin Supplement,,,"I was recommended this serum when I got my makeup done at the mall for a wedding and decided to give it a try. I was very skeptical at first about the pricey purchase, and my skin is usually a little oily/combination type and very sensitive to breaking out. I had never heard of Bobbi Brown or this serum before. Most facial products don't work well with my skin. Before this, I had been using Dr. Weil's Brightening Serum from Origins, which works well for me, but is a little bit drying. The origins serum works pretty good for me and is almost perfect but not quite.

I was pleasantly surprised when all of my acne cleared up as soon as I started using the Intensive Skin Supplement Serum! At first I thought it was a coincidence, but when I stopped using this for a couple days my skin was not as clear. I find that the supplement is not too drying, while also a little bit exfoliating. It has fixed my uneven skin tone from acne and sun over the summer. If you use more than 3-4 drops, it definitely feels sticky, but any less than that absorbs right in. I use it before I apply Clinique's oil-free Moisture Surge and my skin feels amazing after applying them. It leaves my skin dewy, glowing, and extremely smooth.

For me, the only small downside of this product is that the dropper is a little bit annoying to use. It's not as effective as a pump. It's also a little tricky to apply evenly, since the serum sometimes sinks right into my skin in one spot before I can rub it in. I had to get the hang of it. Not really a big deal though, and definitely worth the effort.",,,combination,5,zeebee
Bobbi Brown,Skincare,P270591,48,$75.00,4.1458,Intensive Skin Supplement,,,"I'm really glad I went out on a limb and decided to try this serum. I have dry, sensitive, VERY acne prone skin. I'm currently on Retin-A to help with this, which leaves my skin red and dry. My acne is mostly cleared at this point, but I had some reaaaaaally bad red acne scars on my cheeks that the Retin-A just wasn't fading.

I bought this because it's marketed as non-acnegenic, and it also doesn't have a strong fragrance (I dislike facial products that smell like perfume). It has a light texture for a serum and it actually absorbs into my skin (some serums I've tried are too silicone-heavy and make me feel like I've got a mask on). I put this on after my Retin-A has been absorbed and before my moisturizer at night and under my moisturizer in the morning. After about three weeks of consistent use, I noticed that the scars on my cheeks have begun to fade. The marks are still there, but they are significantly lighter and less noticeable. I've also not gotten any new spots from using this serum.

I use about three drops of this serum twice a day, which I think is one drop more than recommended. I wish this came in a little mini pump because I find the dropper a little annoying...however, nowhere near annoying enough to stop using this product.

All in all, this is a lightweight, easily absorbed serum that might be worth a shot if you have acne scarring you'd like to lighten. It's not heavy enough to use on its own unless you have very oily skin, but it plays nice under my usual cream (no pilling as long as I give it a second to absorb fully). I've also not experienced any burning, stinging, or tightness using this serum on my sensitive skin.",,,,5,birdie717

My natural straight Asian lashes are almost invisible without mascara. I also needed something smudge proof (have really oily lids) that will last all day.

This mascara really delivered! My lashes are well defined, has a bit of curl, darker (it's not super black black), and yet looks perfectly natural. I discovered that my lashes actually have some decent length with this product! I just couldn't see them before due to them being straight and very fine. The formula is on the wet side which meant it was very easy to apply and glides on smoothly. The smaller brush made it easy to reach every lash, give some curl, and not be cumbersome/awkward. Lastly, it delivered on the promise of lasting all day even through a few tears (my eyes are sensitive and tend to water easily). Haven't tried it in rain or with a lot of perspiration though. In fact, this formula is pretty close to waterproof. I have to use eye makeup remover to get it all off. It is close in durability to the Bobbi Brown No Smudge Mascara which I also have. The No Smudge has a drier formula so can be clumpy but is *really* waterproof. The Intensifying Long-Wear is smoother to apply and really a dream to wear and almost as waterproof.

I use a tapered kabuki brush which has the right amount of firmness to pick up the product, yet still fluffy enough to deposit the product how I like. This product does not act as a traditional highlighter, for that you will want something else. But if you want your skin to look flawless, glowy, and photograph extremely well...

But I love a big brush. They work well with my lashes but it was a little intimidating. I have fairly long lashes and a moderate amount of them, but I go for the extra long look and require a little fattening up of my lashes. I also like a deep, glossy blacker than black shade. This mascara met all my wants & needs. A ton of product comes out on the wand but yet it didn't overcoat my lashes to the point of leaving large chunks or clumping them together. One pass had my lashes almost touching my brows. A second coat fattened them up nicely and made them super black. Usually, I'll use 2-3 different mascaras (Primer, They're Real, topped by UD Perversion) to get them the way I like them. This is the first time I was satisfied with just a solo mascara (not even a primer). It doesn't flake, smudge, or flatten my lashes. It's not heavy or stiff/crunchy.

I bought it because the brush was supposed to be something new and never done before! I actually have naturally long lashes, so I just need a little volume and definition. And I'm on the hunt for the perfect mascara, so I thought I'd give it a try. 
Well...it's awful. The formula itself is really, REALLY goopy, and the brush is so huge, that more of the goop ended up on my eyeLIDS than my eyeLASHES. 
This brush would be great for Anime characters, or giants, or you know, people with RIDICULOUSLY HUGE EYES, but not for normal people with normal eyes.
I wore it 3 times, because I wanted to give it a fair chance, but just...NO.
It doesn't have buildable volume, it just clumps and gets spidery. I couldn't really tell you if it's lengthening or not because by the time the brush reached the middle of my lashes, it was already smearing under my eyebrows.

I obviously returned it and got something else.

The brush is GIGANTIC - I thought I was going to have issue with it; I usually prefer a smaller brush. It's very bristle-y. I was really impressed that the want didn't come out of the tube coated with tons of excess product like many mascaras tend to do.

I used ONE COAT of this over my favorite lash primer (Tarte's Opening Act lash primer) and my lashes look AMAZING. I have decent lash length, but almost no volume, and my lashes tend to clump like nobody's business whenever mascara dares touch them. This lengthend, volumized, and separated! I didn't even have to go in with my lash comb after applying this mascara, which is unheard of in my world.

This stuff is also really, really, truly black, which I appreciate. I've gotten great wear time with it, with no flaking, transfer, or smudging (which is impressive, since I have notoriously watery eyes and nearly every non-waterproof mascara tends to migrate).

Cons:
-Made my lashes VERY clumpy. I tried this both with and without a lash primer and saw no difference. I used an eyelash comb, but that didn't even really help too much - my lashes were still clumpy.
-This also flaked off throughout the day and into my eye. I work pretty long shifts, and this mascara didn't even hold up through half of one. My eyes were bothering me most of the day and I noticed flakes of mascara both in and around my eyes. I don't rub my eyes, this just happened on its own.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P395372,52,$44.00,4.5192,Perfectly Defined Long-Wear Brow Pencil,brown,,"I bought this based on the good reviews. However, my experience was not positive. First I will say that I have normal to oily skin. My eyebrow hair stops about half the length of my eye so I needed a pencil not only to fill in, but to also draw in the remainder of my eyebrows.

Pros: 
The pencil is pretty wide, and so are my eyebrows.
The size allowed me to use one stroke since the width was the same as my eyebrows. 


Cons:
 I had to push extremely hard just to get the color to go onto my skin. 
The color never lasted more than a couple hours and that was if I didn't touch it.
The color is very dull and not vibrant. If you are filling in, it may work fine but only if you use a lot of force to get it on.
I have dark hair and dark eyebrows. I ordered the darkest brown but I should've ordered the darkest color they offered because the dark brown went on almost grey.

I returned this one and got the benefit goof proof brow pencil. I like it much better. The color is richer. It stays on longer. The pencil is also narrower so It gives me more flexibility but it shaped the same as this one.",,olive,,2,amanda2684

1) even coverage
2) is soft
3) has not shredded at all so far
4) cleans easily and dries fast although it is dense
5) the density allows for blotting and more absorptive action

Also, because I use a liquid BB cream, I literally use less than a pea size amount and the brush allows me to cover my whole face. Yes the brush is a bit expensive, but because you end up applying less BB cream or foundation it lasts you longer and product is not being lost which tends to happen with other less dense brushes!",,deep,,5,LuvLiveLipstick

Bobbi's brushes have definitely changed over the years, and a lot of my older brushes have the longer ""professional length"" handles. Maybe I just haven't been to the counter recently enough to see what's going on right now, but to me, this brush feels so tiny! It is quite short compared to my other brushes and does not look like it costs what it does.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P390431,62,$48.00,4.7258,Full Coverage Face Brush,,,"Overall Feelings:

I was hesitant to buy this brush due to the cost, but after reading the reviews and speaking with a Bobbi Brown rep I decided to give it a try. I'm so happy I did because hands down this is the best and only brush I will use for my foundation. I get tons of compliments on my actual skin and not foundation. This brush makes your makeup application beautiful. There are no streaks or blotchy coverage giving your skin such a flawless finish (especially if you use bobbi brown foundation). Seriously, the brush seems simple and pricey but so worth the end product. 

  My application:

 I used the Bobbi Brown Foundation stick in the color golden and the amount of coverage is perfect. I swipe the brush on the stick a few times and do one side of my face and then swipe a few more times to do the other side. It gives a nice medium coverage with just a few swipes. If you want a fuller coverage look I suggest doing another layer using the same method to build up.

Tips:
 
Bobbi Brown MUA told me....
When you wash it be gentle you don't have to do a whole lot of scrubbing to clean it. (this will make the brush stay soft, durable -no shedding and fluffy). Also, let it air dry lying flat.
 
Why I love it:

I use less makeup and still get the coverage I want. 
Flawless finish that makes your makeup beautiful.
 Application ensures your makeup last longer and all day.",,,,5,nubiebeauty

All it needs is a little liner underneath (mauves, roses, pinky-browns) and you're good to go. But if you don't even have time for liner, that's okay because this color is perfectly pigmented.

Rosy is a beautiful rosy pink color that just lights up my face and makes my teeth whiter and kir sugar is a georgeous plummy brown nude color that is perfect.
These glosses are super moisturizing,don't chap or make my lips peel and that really says something! Yeah they are kind of skicky but that is what makes them have so much staying power, but they are not thick, slimy, slippery or goopy, just very shiny and beautiful. The scent is like a slight hint of vanilla which is nice. Most lipglosses are a deal breaker for me because scent is huge for me...gives me headaches.

I ended up exchanging it for Bobbi Brown lip gloss and am happier as a result.  But to be fair, this product comes with it's own pros/cons.

Cons:

Color fades to a lighter shade after an hour or so. If you hate reapplying throughout the day this isn't the gloss for you. 

Pros: Stays put. I wear this with no liner/primer underneath and it doesn't bleed at all. Bleeding as a major issue with many lip products for me, so this is a big deal, imo.

 When freshly applied this is just enough pigment without being overpowering. I like a gloss that has just enough color yet won't compete for attention when paired with heavy eye makeup. 

Depending on what your preference is, this gloss has a thicker, tackier feel to it, even when applied as a single coat. I don't mind though. It doesn't feel uncomfortable to me and is probably why the product stays put.",,olive,,4,SwaggerLeigh

I didn't think this lip gloss could get any better, but when they changed to the larger tube and the doe-foot applicator a while back, it was a serious improvement.

I don't think the name or the description they give this lip gloss color is accurate. I know that the color aubergine is an eggplant purple color, but I would say the color of the lip gloss is more of a plumish-berry color - not at all eggplant purple.

Pros
Great color that looks great on a lot of skin tones
Looks great on bare lips or over different shades of lipstick or lipliner
Can wear it super sheer or build the color a bit more
Moisturizing for a lip gloss
The color brightens my entire face without feeling like the color is so bright that people just see lips
Does not have a strong scent

Cons
Like most lip gloss containers, its very hard to get all of the lip gloss out of the container, and it's not cheap, so I try to get every drop from each tube.

Two solutions: close the tube tightly, place it in a cup of warm water, wait a while, and all the lip gloss will run to the bottom, or cut the tube in half, scoop the lip gloss out with the applicator, and then put it in a lip gloss pot or keep the cut tube in a little plastic bag so it doesn't dry out.

The color is just slightly darker and rosier than my natural lip color, so it is something I can apply on the fly. I always keep one at home, at work, in my car, purse ... you get the idea. It's what I use when I don't want to think about it.

The shimmer, which I prefer over Bobbi's non-shimmer and high-shimmer glosses, is gorgeous and subtle. It does not look glittery or feel gritty. While it IS somewhat sticky, I like the thicker consistency because it actually stays put for a relatively long period of time. If you're going to be outside when it's windy, your hair WILL stick to you lips, but for me it's a small price to pay for a gloss that moisturizes, soothes, lasts, and smells like vanilla. I also like to layer it over pigmented lip colors that can be drying.

First, if you don't like stickiness, this isn't the gloss for you. It's gloopy and thick (in all the formulas, sheer, glittery, etc) and the packaging is really some of the worst in the industry.

Frankly, the brush is only good for ONE use. Unless you work very hard to put the brush back in a sort of awkward sideways motion, it WILL end up getting bent out of shape and have bristles going everywhere. It's not just my observation, even counter employees will warn you when you purchase this gloss and give you the ""technique"" to avoid this from happening. Unfortunately, it's unavoidable and the brush will fan out making for a very sloppy and eventually impossible application.

The formulas are very sticky, too and they just fall so short of the rest of the line in my opinion and I can't recommend them for any reason when there are so many better glosses out there.",,light,,1,sbsunshine

The reason for the 2-star rating of this product is the packaging. For $22, I expect something that looks bigger than a sample size product. In addition, after using the product once, the brush fans out and becomes very difficult to use. The quality of the brush is seriously something you would expect of a dollar-store lip gloss brush.

Brush applicator is terrible. Once you start using the gloss, when the app goes back into tube, the brush just fails. It bends, the bristles take a beating & never recover. Then, you can't put the gloss on evenly because the bristles are in every direction.

The gloss is STICKY! now I know gloss needs to be a certain consistency to achieve the 'glossy' look, but this is off the charts sticky. I can't stand having it on my lips. And I'm a gloss girl!

I have a color that has a little shimmer in it. I have come to the conclusion that the shimmer is really sand because it is gritty! Honestly I'm so disappointed in this product.

Here is my trick to add color to the lighter glosses. I used the Sephora Collection Lip Cream Stain in Shimmering Hot Pink or the Infinite Rose (which is a light peach color).

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P406623,36,$48.00,4.3611,Brightening Brick Blush and Bronzer,brown,,"Those Brightening Bricks look so pretty. However I personally find them to be quite mediocre when applied. I gave them 4 stars because of the product presentation.

1. Powder is too hard. My brush just can't kick it up easily, and it's hard to mix all six shades. I prefer powders with much softer consistency, so I have control over how much I use. This one I can't. Only a little bit of powder gets on my brush each time. And BB's Nude Illuminating palette suffers from the same issue.

2. My skin tone is quite fair, but both Pink and Coral palettes looked similar when applied. Bummer that so many pretty blushes looked like the same mediocre pink on face.

3. Sheer and build-able. It's quite natural looking, and the shimmer disappears when applied.

I will probably keep this blush regardless or give it to my mom. After all it is very pretty to look at and feels good in the hand. It would have been an absolutely amazing product if the powder is softer.",,light,combination,3,koalabingham88

I've tried some of the other shimmer bricks, but to me Rose always looks the most natural, especially for paler people, though it looks great with a tan too. The shimmer really adds dimension and brings your cheekbones out without looking fake or too heavy, and it softens the color so it looks right on everyone--and just putting loose or pressed powder on over it makes it a little more matte for day.

Other plus of this bronzer is that is does not look orange at all when applied to the skin (on the picture it looks slightly orangey but it because of the color shift and the lighting), it has buildable coverage and the color shifts with light - again depending on the shades you use.

These shadows apply lightly, provide semi-sheer coverage which can be built up to full as desired. Works best with a cream shadow brush, sometimes a smooth wedge sponge is nice. The great thing: modern cream shadows can be layered between layers of powder eyecolor, without losing the benefit of either cream or shadow! Even the blue colors can be worn without creating a bruised look. Comes in Bobbi's characteristic glass jars, which are heavy to carry around in a makeup kit and may break if you're unlucky.

Once it's on, don't mess with it - can make a bit of a mess on old crepey lids even if it's waterproof; hard to explain. Will last for more than 12 hours without touching up if left alone :-). Find that with my cooler skin tone - fair, green eyes, hooded 46 year-old lids - that I have trouble getting the 'right' color, most seem to be too warm/yellow/orange/reddish on me. Silver dollar and shore are gorgeous, but on me look a bit ghastly(dollar) and orangey (shore). Cement fits better. Bone is very light, best just on the lid, otherwise seems to accentuate the bit of puffiness on my inner top eyelid. Cool lilac is very soft and pretty, especially when applied with brush. Unfortunately have more colors in the drawer that I find I don't use. Wish Bobbi would come out with more. The shimmers - velvet plum especially, are soft and best applied over a matte like bone.

If you have long nails, it can be tough to manipulate without getting shadow under your nail or making a mess. But the plus side is it seems like the pot design will keep the shadow from drying out.",,olive,,4,EmJ628
Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P270560,355,$30.00,4.3577,Long-Wear Cream Shadow,blue,,"I'm a Bobbi junkie and have been using various shades of the long-wear shadow for years. Wore the sandy gold color for my beach wedding, and I was hooked. The color stays true through 12 hour work shifts, with no creasing, and is the perfect base for her gel liner. The trick is to put the shadow on a bare lid; eye creams or primers will cause creasing. I like using a brush to apply, then lightly tapping in with my finger to blend. Powder shadows can be layered on top, but for work I generally just use the cream. Bone is a great base for fair skin; heather looks great with blue eyes, a pinky blush, and your LBD. Stone is perfect with BB tawny blush, espresso gel liner and brown lip color. I wear that combo to work almost every day.

The color shore is one that I can wear as a base for any eyeshadow and also one I can wear alone for a natural makeup look.

They glide on smooth as butter, dry quickly, and last all day and night. I've never had an issue with creasing, clumping, or flaking. I tend to wear mine as a base for other shadows, but they look lovely on their own as well. It's really easy to blend and layer these shadows with themselves or even with other shadow formulas.

This cream shadow really does stay put all day long, and I didn't even have to use a primer.

I bought it in Sandy Gold, which on me looks like a perfect beige with slight gold shimmer (for reference, I have dark brown hair, brown eyes, and wear BE mineral foundation in Medium Beige). It goes on light and blendable but is buildable for more coverage if you want it.

I applied this with BB's cream shadow brush, which I really like. It gets the product out of the pot easily and makes application easy. I also tried blending on the eye with my finger, which seemed to make this particular shade look more gold (like I wiped away the beige pigment and left only the gold shimmer). I can see using that technique at night to glam it up a little, but I'll have to be careful not to do that during the day (so the brush really does make a difference in application and results).

That said, I can't wait to try other colors. The formula is great. This plus BBs gel eye liner, and my eyes look ""just done"" all day long. Fabulous.",,medium,,5,carriecat

This time round I decided to skip the brights and pick up Rose Brown as it seemed the best day-to-day shade for my skintone (MAC NC44 or Sephora IQ 3Y09) but true to the previous reviews of this shade it's definitely more of a 90's brown that'll be more flattering on me once I lose the summer tan so it stands out a bit more. I wish I had the opportunity to test the product before purchasing (I likely would have picked another shade) but for now I guess I'm helping bring the 90's back this fall.

1. Glides amazingly on your lips

2. Allows you to apply with precision - the pencil tip lets you reach all the crevices and pencil side colours the lip uniformly

3. Long-lasting. I put it on at 7am and it lasted the entire day. I re-apply once at 6pm and that was it.

4. Beautiful matte colour - if you don't like glossy things (like me), this product is great for you. I purchased dusty pink first - it's a subtle pink great for ladies that wants a natural look. Then, I went to get the electric pink brings out a little more pop for drama. I wear and love both of them for different reasons: dusty pink for work (I'm a teacher) and electric pink (going out),

Her color range is not as extensive or exciting as other lines carried by Sephora, but for basics, BB eyeshadows can't be beat!

It is a matte color that I use all over my eye as a base/highlight shade. It goes with every color I own, and is the workhorse of my eye shadow collection. If yellow toned base colors are too yellow for your skin tone or your eye makeup design, this is the color for you.

I am really impressed by the quality of these shadows. Because Bobbi Brown was a ""late arrival"" at the Sephora stores near me, I never bothered with trying the products (I have enough brand addictions already at Sephora) so had it not been for this VIB perk palette, I'd never have found these great shadows or the amazing blush and mascara that were part of the ""perk"").",,light,,5,dancingdream99

These two are my favs at present, although the Bone is almost gone, indicating that I’ve used it a lot in the past.
Once I discovered Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, I began using it as an eye primer for my 63-year-old eyes that are still very oily. With my brown eyes, Tan seems to be best. I recently received Espresso: much too dark for me, but I’ve been able to mute it, with any of the lighter shades, to a fine grey.

Taupe is a taupe brown and Caviar is a dark brown almost black shade. The Taupe was okay, but not very exciting, and something about Caviar didn't really work for me as shadow, but used wet, it made a nice eye liner. The shadows themselves are excellent quality, don't fade (I used a primer), and didn't crease. While I didn't like these shades, I'm certainly not going to take off stars for this, because I can't blame the product for my friend's selection of shades for my birthday present. While I would have chosen different shades, the shadow itself is still excellent albeit slightly overpriced for what it is. This shadow blends well and is long lasting. It's a good eye shadow. What I really like is that my friend included an empty palette so that I could put three of these shadows (or any Bobbi Brown shadows) into one palette, if I want.

It looks really pretty on dark skin and it is buildable, but I think a medium application looks best. I wore a very light application of it without primer or anything else on my face the first time and it did seem to wear away within a few hours, maybe 3 or 4.

It's too bright for use as the primary blush that you put all over your cheeks; as suggested by Bobbi Brown in her makeup tutorials, Pale Pink is best used as the ""pop"" color that you apply only to the apples of the cheeks, as a highlight to pick up your complexion. For the all-over blush color that you apply all along cheekbones sweeping up into the hairline and blending down, choose a more natural shade such as Tawny.

It's really not a bad cream, its just not very hydrating if you have really dry skin. If you have normal/combination skin - this should work great for you. If you still really want to try it out, get a sample. I love bobbi brown products, however, this one is just not for me.

It keeps the brush clean from build up and you have to clean it anyways. I highly suggest buying this brush.",,fair,,5,dkbe01

I always used an angled brush to apply liner because I felt it gave me a sharper line. However, since my old liner brush had begun to lose shape, I thought I would look around for a new brush.

I was hesitant about the price at first, but after I used it I understood why it was so expensive. It is extremely good quality, retains its shape very well, and gives very precise lines. It makes wings a breeze (which is not easy!).

A lot of reviews compare the scent to Copertone, but personally I think it smells more like Hawaiian Tropics sunscreen with a touch of salt ocean water. As other reviews have said, it doesn't have the best staying power (I have to spray more than I'm used to spraying when applying perfume) it reminds me more of a body spray than a perfume.

Bobbi Brown,Fragrance,P270559,363,$78.00,4.1157,Beach Fragrance,,,"At first spray, I wasn't feeling it. It was a strong sunscreen smell and I wondered what all the hype was about. I moved on, but after less than two minutes, that initial blast had softened to a much nicer beachy scent, and after another minute or so, had dried down into this amazing sunscreen+orange+sea air scent. To me, it really is like a sophisticated sunscreen smell. It lasts maybe 3 hours on me, which is not long enough for the price, but the scent itself deserves 5 stars and it's definitely a summer staple for me. If you are in a store and spray it on a piece of cardstock, you may walk away, but give it a chance on your own skin and see if you like the drydown that comes after a couple of minutes, because that's what sold me on it. If you're looking for another scent along these lines, the Sea Spray hair mist from Lush smells similar to this and the notes in that are orange flower, neroli, grapefruit and rosewood.",,,,5,ultrafinepoint

Bobbi Brown,Fragrance,P270559,363,$78.00,4.1157,Beach Fragrance,,,"Living in NJ, I spend a lot of time down the shore and I've always said if someone bottled the fragrance of the shore I'd wear it everyday. ""Beach"" comes closest to that scent. I tried Jennifer Anniston - which also has a day-down-the-shore scent - but much lighter with no staying power-Beach does last. As for the scent itself - some reviewers did not care for what they called ""sunscreen"" scent. I find it to be a combination of sun, sand, ocean and the scent of sun-tan lotions we used years ago - not the chemical or fruity cover-up scent we get today. If you're looking for a summer citrus or flower scent - this isn't it. But then again, it's called ""Beach,"" not ""Summer Fruit and Flowers."" I get so many compliments - but again - I live in NJ where many people are shore enthusiasts so the response is always, ""You smell so good - like a day at the beach!""

This is a very nostalgic sent for some, and for whatever reason, an ""Eww"" for others. I love it. It says a lot that I remember where I was the first time I smelled this.

I am so thrilled Sephora is carrying it! Since moving to the PNW from New England 11 years ago, I miss the smell of the beach/ocean the most. BB Beach really does capture the scent in the air when driving down I-95 right by the coast. I'm so happy it works so well with my body chemistry. I wear it from April - September and sniff the bottle when I feel homesick. I have had the fragrance 'turn' towards the end of the bottle. It becomes really scratchy. When it becomes scratchy, I decant it out of the bottle and dab it on. Dabbing it on seems to really mitigate the scratchiness. Love love love it forever!",,,,5,ShadoWitch
Bobbi Brown,Fragrance,P270559,363,$78.00,4.1157,Beach Fragrance,,,"Yep this smells like sunscreen. With a name like Beach, that's what I expected from this. I wanted a perfume that smelled like salty sea air and sunscreen and that's exactly what this is. I don't get ""jasmine"" or ""mandarin"" at all from this but I do get the ""sea spray"". This smells like sand, sun, saltwater, sunscreen, and bug spray (yes, bug spray, but in a good way). I say sample this at your local Sephora if you can. This seems like a love it or hate it fragrance. It has decent lasting power on me. Once I start wearing it more during the summer season then I feel like it only lasts five minutes but that's just because I'm used to it. When I transition to this at the beginning of summer from a different fragrance, it lasts all day until my nose gets used to it.",,,,5,heh8787

So if you love the smell of sunscreen, you'll flip for this fragrance; if not, steer clear! :) I personally find it to be great blended with other fragrances that have prominent fruity or vanilla notes - Beach balances out the sweetness of those scents, and lends that sexy, summery feel to your fragrance wardrobe. :) Worn alone, you'll close your eyes and think you're at the beach.

It's definitely a very trasportive scent, I swear I feel like I'm going to find sand somewhere on my body even if I'm no where near the beach! The perfume itself is also really wonderful with it's lasting power, I just spritz my wrist twice and once behind each ear and I'm good to go for at least 12 hours. It is nice if you can purchase the shower gel and lotion because it just adds to the experience, but really as long as you have the perfume you are good to go! Just as a reference the other two fragrances I'm in love with for their beachy vibe are Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess and Kate Spade Live Colorfully, all three have their similarities, but they are still pretty different fragrances.

Bobbi Brown,Fragrance,P270559,363,$78.00,4.1157,Beach Fragrance,,,"This fragrance is not for everyone. It does not smell like ""beach"" candles. It smells exactly like you do after you spray yourself down with aerosol sunscreen (from the popular company that begins with a C). You smell exactly like YOU do at the beach and not how the beach itself smells with winds coming off the ocean and coconut drinks in your hand (and scented lotion on your body). Like the description says, it is a ""nostalgic scent."" The second I sprayed it on I was transferred back to a hotel shower spraying generous sunscreen on before going out to the beach. I do have the issue that some people have mentioned with the scent not lingering long enough. I put extra on during the day if I remember to, and I can smell it when I take my shirt off at night. Even though I rotate through three fragrances, this bottle is still disappearing quickly. SO, if you want to smell like YOU actually do during your time at the beach, this is for you. If you are expecting a typical ""ocean"" or ""beach"" scent, you should get a candle. That's why I gave it 4 stars. Many people will not want this.",,,,4,

When first sprayed, it really reminds me of sun warmed skin with a bit of yumming smelling suntan lotion and as it starts to dry down it's just a very light, clean fragrance - reminds me of how you smell after you've been at the beach all day and take a shower at the end of the day. It is definately more of a ""clean"" scent as opposed to a sexy one, but that is what I was looking for. It's difficult to pick out specific notes, but what stands out in the dry down is a hint of jasmine. The scent is fabulous, but it doesn't last long at all (which I do find a lot with summer fragrances) but for the price, and the fact that it is an eau de parfum, it should last a little longer. I can tell this bottle won't last long, and usually a bottle of perfum this size will last me a few years. I think I'll buy the body oil as well to see if layering helps the scent last longer.

However, I can wear Beach! I love love love the smell. I first spritzed this on a sampler card thing at Sephora, and loved how light, sweet, and fresh it smelled. I didn't get a headache, so then I spritzed some on myself. I then walked around the mall for an hour, then came back to the store to buy it. It was the first fragrance that I'd bought in about five years, and it's the only fragrance I've repurchased... twice.

Is it the longest lasting fragrance? No, and I find that's the case with all lighter fragrances. I keep the rollerball in my purse for when I feel I need a touch up. I would say it reminds me of a day at the beach, because it smells like fresh air, ocean water (salt water, not fresh water!), a hint of sunscreen, and a hint of a tropical citrusy drink. In other words, all good things. My husband thinks I smell ""clean"" and am ""huggable"" when I wear it.

But as with all fragrances, everything smells different on everyone.

It does not cause skin irritations and leaves a very subtle pinky stain on your lips. My comparison product is Sephora's, ""Unique Pink"" chap stick that adjusts to your pH levels and leaves a natural pink color. This product is not as glossy and leaves a nice color, but it requires re-application at least once an hour. I rate this 4 stars instead of 5 because it is $33USD.

Though it  transfers a little through a kiss, it just sort of stays put on your lips without migrating or smearing, even onto teeth. The finish is a low maintenance, blotted matte that isn't drying and doesn't settle into lines, and the staying power on bare lips is a fuss free couple of hours. I bought Lilac, a blue rose without brown or grey undertones, and though it's slightly more intense than I anticipated, it's flattering. I'd call this a wearable bold on me (brunette with fair skin and yellow undertones). I'm scent sensitive (they trigger migraines for me) but didn't notice any smell or taste like some reviewers have mentioned. Over all I really love this, and will definitely be buying more.

I found it to be a candy pink color that had coral undertones.  I felt a little clown-ish wearing it.  Maybe it would work for me with a deep tan and a cute summer dress - but otherwise I don't have any use for it.  

I was also dismayed to find that it faded fast.  I kept reapplying it, but that kind of turned my lips into a sticky mess.  This ""lipstick"" reminded me more of a lip balm.  I liked the texture when I first applied it, though.",,light,combination,2,greeneyedgirl107

Regal is more of a brighter pinky red, Ruby is very subdued, can barely see it and Cherry is the prettiest deepest red in my opinion. The color is very subtle. They feel very much like a balm and go on softly and smoothly but don't last very long at all tho they each left a little stain. They all feathered a little bit. Not buttery like Fresh but more of a hybrid lip and balm with a bit more color. Not a lot and I had hoped had more. The strong smell and taste was quite off -putting to me at first also though I'm getting a bit more used to it. Still not my favorite taste however and it did surprise me. Will be curious to see other colors as they are released. Nice for summer but just wish had more depth for fall. Crush is probably pretty accurate.",,,,4,Sunnysmom
Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P422224,93,$29.00,4.3226,Crushed Lip Color,brown,black,"It's moisturizing, long lasting, but has the texture of a balm. It semi sheer but can be built up to be very pigmented. It lasts a long time but as it fades it gives a staining effect on the lips so it still looks good. I have it in Cherry - which is pop of slightly muted red. It is wearable for everyday and not a shocking red. I also have it in a couple colors that Sephora doesn't carry. I got them at Nordstrom. Watermelon is a beautiful bright pinky / coral for when you want to get attention. Cabana is a pretty cheery wearable everyday color muted corally rose shade. Something I notice about these colors is that - more than most lipsticks they look different depending on your lip color. Even though this is true for most makeup I think with these you should really try them on or look online for someone testing them out that has the same natural lip color or skin tone as you. I have kind of brownish, mauvey pigmented lips naturally and when I wear these the color blends well to make my natural lip color prettier but these colors will look way more vibrant on someone with lighter pinker lips. For instance Cabana looks way pinker on me than in the tube because of the cooler tone on my natural lip. But the reason I liked this so much is that it goes on very flattering even though it is sheer. Many sheer lipsticks go on streaky and when my natural lip color shows through it is really unflattering. Either that or it is so sheer that the pigment doesn't brighten cover my natural color enough. But there is something special about this formula that it is able to blends well and also cover ever darker more pigmented lips. To compare to another very popular lipstick, in my lipstick collection it is most similar to the Bite Amuse Bouche lipsticks in how they feel balmy. The difference is that those are heavier and more opaque. I love those too, but I like these even better.",,medium,combination,5,slinky2014

They apply smoothly, and have a very tiny bit of shine.  I myself don't care for a very bold lip, so these did not work for me.

I've experimented with applying it over a thin layer of rosehip oil and it created a lovely opaque gloss that felt extra nourishing. 

I can wear it without lip liner or a primer and it still lasts basically all day with no need for touch up anywhere but the inner edge of my lips (I'm bad for biting my lips when I'm anxious though so if you don't do that you probably wouldn't need to fix it).

I was very excited because I've been on the search for the perfect light neutral lipstick.

Carnation ended up being a very orange color. It is described as a peachy pink, but there was no pink, and it wasn't light peach - it was a bright orange. Very disappointed. The texture of this lipstick was beautiful, however - thick, rich and creamy. Applied easily in one swipe and wasn't drying - able to blend easily without it leaving lip area red or overworked. I'd love to try more colors, but I think I'll wait until Spring 2011 when the stores carry them in-store, rather than buying them sight unseen from on-line.

I was looking for a BROWN color (not pinky brown or beige) for the winter to make my blue eyes pop and oh Lordy did I find it. I purchased Cocoa 31. I loved everything about it the second I put it on my lips. It is so creamy and hydrating; it doesn't run off your lips or onto your teeth like some other brands do.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P270541,440,$29.00,4.35,Lipstick,hazel,,"I have been looking for the perfect pink for what feels like a lifetime. Why has the search taken so long? Well, the main problem has been that I am warm-complected, and most pinks seem to turn purple-ish on me (even many pinks on the coral-ish end of the spectrum). I'm not really sure why that is, but no matter. Another factor is, I like the vintage look, so I prefer matte lipsticks, and there simply aren't very many of those being made these days. But, saints be praised, I recently stumbled upon Bobbi Brown Lip Color. It has a semi-matte finish - not quite perfect, in my definition, but awfully darn close - and comes in a lovely shade named Carnation. Carnation is the first pink I've found which doesn't turn purple on me and at the same time isn't too orange-y, and isn't so bright that I end up looking like an old lady on her way to church but isn't so pale that I end up looking like a corpse. It's practically perfect in every way.

I got the color Soft Rose, which is a mlbb shade that's a little more intense than my natural lip color and really perks up my complexion.  I have some pink in my skin so this shade is perfect for me.  This formula is richly pigmented, not drying at all and has a satin finish rather than a super shiny one.  I definitely like it a lot and will wear it every day for the next week or so in order to give it a thorough test.  But so far, I like it a lot and I may just get another shade during the upcoming sale.  It's definitely on par with other lipsticks that last a long time for me (Chanel, Guerlain, Nars).

This is a cream lipstick and wears like one. There are other formulas if creams don't work for you. But for a cream, this is a great formula! It doesn't run into my fine lines and it has decent wear. It has no funny smell or taste and has just the right amount of shine but not too much. It's moisturizing to my lips and non-irritating.

Ladies, this is no joke, when she applied the powder I was so amazed by the soft and smooth finish, it did not cake or look heavy, the powder was light and the more I applied the better it looked.

This is my first Bobbi Brown product and I have to say I am hooked. I have been wearing it consistently for the last 4 days I am happy every time. The powder is long lasting at least 7 to 10 hours of wear and I never have to touch up using more powder. I may blot my nose once if it appears shiny but never needing to apply more foundation.

They look light in the pan but apply darker. There is only very slight oxidation with this one and the shade I got is yellow-based. It's suuuper flattering..there are tiny shiny pigments in the formula. NOT glitter or shimmer but something so deliciously flattering and gives a wonderful glow. It looks even better as the day goes on and gives me an even better glow. I literally can admire myself in the mirror after an 8 hr day with this on (and my skin is far from perfect). Goes on smooth and doesnt accenuate my dry patches or look cakey..I almost didnt believe that a powder foundation could do that.

I only used it 1 or 2 times throughout the day as a touch up & i have normal/dry skin. The only reason I dont like this product is the case! The sides of the powder kept cracking & kept coming loose & only after 3 uses. I thought i had a faulty one so i exchanged it with no issues & the same thing happened with the other one. I rarely use it but the edges of the powder would crack & the metal pan would wiggle. I finally exhanged it for something else bcz i couldnt keep it in my makeup bag.,,,,3,beautyathena

I do finish everything off with my Bobbi Brown Re-Touching Powder (holy grail product!), to mattify and give an airbrush look. So my complexion products are indeed a layering process to get my desired look. This works perfectly in my complexion routine.

My 2nd review for this is using it alone as a powder foundation... I'd give it 3 stars. I don't feel like it offers much coverage, and it does give more of a dewy glowy look than what I prefer.

Will this cream make a 40 year old look 20? No.

No eye cream will do all those things permanently. Read that sentence again. There is no miracle in a jar - even if that's the name of the product. Any kind of cream temporarily plumps and moisturizes - that's it. Accept it.

I'm closing in on 40, have dark circles under my eyes that I've had since I was a child and crow's feet and laugh lines. Generally the skin under my eyes is dry. Everyone's skin, age, and genetics are different, and we all have different skin care needs, so I offer that information as an example of who this eye cream might work for.

I've tried lots of different brands of eye creams at all price ranges, and I've accepted that there is no miracle. The best thing is to have a healthy lifestyle, stay out of the sun, wear sunscreen, and invest in a good under-eye concealer. Bobbi Brown has two great ones: corrector and creamy concealer - they're great quality and last a long time.

After about the first 6 to 8 weeks of use I could tell a big difference in the look of my eyes. They looked brighter, my fine lines were softened and my eye area looked younger in general. I have oily and sensitive skin, but this eye cream did not irritate my eyes or make the skin underneath the least bit red. It takes such a small amount for each usage that a jar will last me for months. It’s a part of my nighttime skincare regimen that I do not ever skip and I would recommend this eye cream for anyone interested in trying it. I’ve been using this cream for quite some time and I’m glad I can now get it at Sephora. The only reason I’m giving it a 4 star rating instead of five is because it is a little pricey even though it does last a long time.",,fair,oily,4,tenngal

Smell: nice light cucumber light scent, not offensive and probably won't irritate those sensitive to fragrance.

Consistency: very greasy, oil or melted butter like.

Depuffing: unlike some of the higher end creams where effect is evident within minutes, this did nothing. I don't have dark circles that are bad - I don't even wear or need concealer, but this did nothing for the minor dark circles that I have.

Wrinkles, I don't have any fine lines yet as I am in my mid twenties, so I can't comment on it's effectiveness.

I have a dry undereye with very purple/blue pigmented dark circles. I am fair skinned and Porcelain is the perfect shade for me. You cannot expect to apply this like a you tube beauty blogger.

There is a learning curve to this concealer and you need to let go of your past experiences applying loads of product under the eye. This does require a powder to set it, but once you learn correct amount and master blending it out you will never look back.

I absolutely loved La Mer's before they went and ruined it (it used to come in a compact and now it's a stick), so I was looking for a replacement. The shade ""sand"" is the PERFECT shade for me in this, and is similar to what La Mer's radiant concealer in medium used to be (an extremely LIGHT ""medium""). But this concealer is really ONLY for people like me-- someone who has BAD dark circles. It really is JUST a dark circle concealer. And it is SO much better than Tarte's ""shape tape"" it isn't even funny. Unlike ""shape tape,"" this one doesn't crease, and most importantly, doesn't SMELL (Tarte's is HEAVILY perfumed)!!! Plus it's so brightening!!! This is the exact type of concealer you need to cover dark circles. So it makes me wonder what the people who are writing these bad reviews expect... This concealer is not meant for blemishes or anything else-- ONLY dark circles. And for someone like me, that is EXACTLY what I need!! This is second only to La Mer's concealer (the one they used to make, like I said). Cle de Peau's isn't even as good as this, because it's too dry for the under eyes.

As you should with ANY concealer, make sure to use this with a good eye cream. Bobbi's own Hydrating Eye Cream is a good option because it has a built in primer in it. Use just enough eye cream because this product is meant to be moisturizing. It's definitely NOT dry and cakey when you properly prep the skin. The applicator is made so that most of the product is on the very tip, so I would start by dotting a bunch of little dots around the eye area or wherever you want concealer, and then using the side of the applicator to blend using swiping motions. Then just blend the edges with your fingers. It's amazing. You may need to set this a little bit because the finish is definitely more luminous and it doesn't dry down as much as say NARS radiant creamy or Tarte Shape Tape. It's a really great product though. Highly recommend.",,,,5,annieragot
Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P420900,135,$30.00,3.7481,Instant Full Cover Concealer,,,"After browsing through all the negative (and positive) reviews, I thought I would share my own. This is my new favorite concealer for a few reasons. While the concealer is thick, it's actually hydrating and has a lot of pigment, therefore, you only need a little bit. Reading the other reviews it seems that people found it heavy and cakey but I think they are over using the product. 

I use my fingers to blend it into the skin. Most people are complaining that it is patchy when used with a beauty blender. I'd like to point out that Bobbi Brown does not have a makeup sponge and actually recommends using fingers for makeup application (in general). This product was simply not designed to be used with a beauty blender. The warmth from your fingers melts the product and allows for a seamless, beautiful blend into the skin. Again, do not over use! You only need a few small swipes. I start at the inner corner and make about 3 swipes, no further than the center of my eye. Then dab with my finger to spread the product outwards. If you are trying to highlight and draw a giant triangle under your eye with this, this isn't the product for you. 

Also, this concealer is designed for the under-eye area, which should be properly hydrated prior to makeup. I use the Bobbi Brown hydrating eye cream and they make a wonderful pair. I also read that someone stated that this concealer doesn't work well with other Bobbi Brown products...I use Bobbi Brown Skin foundation and have no issues. 

I set the concealer with the Laura Mercier Secret Brightening Powder and I do not have any creases, which is usually my biggest issue with concealers. It's also long-wearing. I typically wear my makeup for 8-12 hours and do not notice and fading or creasing at all. 

Finally,  I'd like to mention that I don't think this concealer was designed to be used on the face. Something so hydrating typically does not work well to cover blemishes, you need something drier. I use the Bobbi Brown retouching pencil to cover pimples and post acne marks. It works great for me. 

All in all, this is a great concealer and I am so happy that it is on the market. I find it to be hydrating, full coverage, non-creasing and long-wearing. For me, this checks off all my boxes. If used minimally on properly prepped skin, it's a wonderful product.",,,,5,c0urtn3ylynn3

So save yourself a few bucks and just buy the creamy concealer sans the pressed powder. I'm not sure if Sephora offers it, but the product home page does.

You DO need to layer this with a corrector in order to get the best results if you have darker circles. I use a lighter pink drugstore corrector and it works just fine, so I'd say the BB Corrector isn't necessarily the only thing that'll work with this concealer. When you apply the products, put on a thin layer of corrector, a VERY thin layer of concealer, and then tap on the powder VERY GENTLY (don't swipe!) with a small, fluffy eyeshadow brush.

Downsides are that there is SOME fading over the course of a 9 hour workday, but not nearly as much as I've seen with other concealers. Go get shade-matched in order to make sure you get the right shade. This stuff is worth the $ - AND the time you need to invest into getting it right.

I have VERY difficult skin and have an awful time finding things that work for me.  I am always oily, and looking like I am melting by lunch, yet if I use mattifying products made for oily skin, I actually end up even oilier and cakier looking because my skin is actually dehydrated, and then produces even more oil. Yet, if I use products made for dry skin, they are loaded with oils and I look like a mess.  I have tried nearly EVERY brand in Sephora.  Literally.  I have NEVER seen a powder like this.  It goes on beautifully, and STAYS that way!!  I am absolutely blown away by this product.  It is ""matte"" in that it doesn't have that dewy, shiny finish, yet it does not look chalky and powdery as most matte products do. It is more of an airbrushed, natural looking finish.  And it is literally the only powder I have ever used that still looks fresh and great hours later.  I did not know a powder this good existed.  I was ready to give up, just figuring if you have to wear makeup, you have to deal with looking chalky, oily, made up sometimes.  But this powder has proved me wrong.  It is very sheer, as it says, so don't expect to get any coverage out of it.  But it is the PERFECT setting powder.  I have also used it to touch up (after several hours, and even then I could have done without) and it works beautifully.  Doesn't cake up (although I do use a fluffy brush, both to set with and if I touch up - I  just find this to work much better than using the puff/sponge - doesn't disturb foundation and gives light, soft airbrushed look)",,light,combination,5,beautyjunkie129

Bobbi Brown has great yellow products so I was expecting this to be super yellow but was a bit dissapointed. It has the slightest yellow undertone.

For whatever reason many reviewers did not seem to realize that this powder IS NOT MENT TO BE A FOUNDATION.

""What it is:
A finely milled, translucent face powder to set foundation and cut excess shine.""

It is exactly that. This powder is to SET your foundation! Thats why it is sheer so it wont affect your foundation color. If this is giving you a white cast you are applying way too much product to your face girl! Unless you have darker skin then you obviously need to go for the darker shades. You are not supposed to apply an excessive amount of finishing powder to your face thats what foundation is for. Foundation can be buildable to provide full coverage.
Anyway this powder is ment to control the oils in your face and set foundation so it wont budge or fade off. When you apply it over your foundation it instantly matteifys your face. If a matte finish is not your thing a setting spray gives a more natural dewy finish (thats what I do)

Overall it is great at controlling my oily tzone and my makeup lasts all day with this on!",,light,,4,ccindyy

I’ve tried pretty much every popular formula the past 4 or 5 years and now cleared out almost all of them and gone back to the staples I have been using for 10  years. Not to say the experimenting wasn’t fun - it absolutely was and I kept some favorites - but I’m a busy professional and on an early work morning thisnpalette is exactly what I need. Pretty, neutral, but able to be amped up in a soft an sophisticated way. I think a lot of people don’t like the line’s shadows because they’re used to very intense, very sparkly or opaque offerings from other brands that are in right now - and these are a softer more layerable look (rather than something in your face that has to be carefully blended out.) it’s all in knowing what you want (or which thing for which occasion in my case.).

Although I feel like these colors have been done time and time again.. many different versions with different brands, Bobbi Brown made herself a front runner with this one! The shimmers are super pigmented and the mattes were made just right. I saw this online the night before going to an event at sephora, bought it that following morning and have used it everyday since. The size of the palette is good too. It's not too small where I feel like I need to bring more colors with me just in case and it's not so big that I can't bring it with me to work in my makeup bag.

I can be a bit heavy handed when applying shadows so with this palette never have to worry about too much glitter. 

If you're looking for that high pigmentation for cut crease, super bold insta makeup look, this is not the palette for you. But if you want subtle but classy everyday looks you can take to work and for afterwork drinks, this is definitely a GREAT palette.",,medium,combination,5,Jennerades

I prefer something with more pigment that I can control and build. The mattes were fine but the shimmers were not good at all. They require a sticky base in order to apply them on the eye otherwise they are so sheer they disappear on the eye. There are a couple of the shades that are more toppers than good used on their own.  Also too glittery for me.  I love shimmers but not glittery shades that tend to fade and fallout on the face over time. I have a number of neutral palettes that offer me that good mix. I really just bought this because I didn't have any Bobbie Brown palettes and wanted to try it.  I think I will avoid these in the future.

All the looks I created were a bit one-note, because the shimmers don't look that different from each other on the eye. They all just read as generic metallic glitter. Ugh!

I can take this palette alone when traveling and it will be useful for creating numerous looks with the plentiful mattes, metallics, and shimmers.

The mattes are very buttery and blendable (little to no fall-out), which is nice when you're getting ready in the morning and don't have time for all that brush-work. The shimmer shades can be intensified if used wet, otherwise they don't distinguish very much from each other dry. If you're going for the natural ""Kate Middleton"" look, this is for you!

This is not a palette for someone who wants ""In-your-face"" pigment from an eye shadow. That's not to say this eye shadow palette is not pigmented, it is. What I love is the buildable pigments in this palette. it makes it harder to mess up or make your eyes look too harsh. The looks you create from it are far more sophisticated than other palettes. Any time I use this palette, even though I have many other nude palettes, my husband notices immediately. It's his favorite palette for me to wear now lol. I love the sparkle shadows because they are not gaudy. They are a more sophisticated sparkle, which seems to be the theme of the palette. If you're thinking about buying this palette, you will need to work a bit harder to build up the pigments, but it's not because it's a bad palette, it is just a different formula than the popular brands of today, such as, Anastasia Beverly Hills. If you are a person looking for a rich pigment where your brush is coated as soon as you touch the pan, this is not the eye shadow palette you are looking for.

The shimmer really adds dimension and brings your cheekbones out without looking fake or too heavy, and it softens the color so it looks right on everyone--and just putting loose or pressed powder on over it makes it a little more matte for day.

Other plus of this bronzer is that is does not look orange at all when applied to the skin (on the picture it looks slightly orangey but it because of the color shift and the lighting), it has buildable coverage and the color shifts with light - again depending on the shades you use.

I don't press hard whatsoever, so It was such a disappointment that the tip broke after using it for 2 weeks. Once the tip is gone, you don't have anymore product. It's not a ""mechanical/twisty"" pencil so all of the product is at the tip.

A beautiful soft gold luminously without being too white or yellow. And the formulation plays a role in that too. It's not so powdery that it comes off too pigmented and stark onto your cheek bones. Not a huge fan of those time of highlighters. If you're looking for that perfect sheen, almost a liquid glow in powder form on your face without becoming too shiny during the day like a liquid highlighter, this is for you. Absolutely my favorite highlighter or all time. I just don't know how to describe with words how it gives that perfect sheen without looking so powdery and glittery. And because of its formulation it's actually pretty blendable, much more blendable than any highlight I've used so you'll never end up with that weird circular splotch or weird stripe of light on your cheek.

Now to the reason this is missing a star.. the packaging feels so cheap. So cheap it feels like it's some drugstore makeup. Actually I have some stuff from Milani that feels more sturdy than this does. It's kinda disheartening that you're paying just about 50 dollars for something that feels so cheaply made.

Pink Glow on the other hand was a big disappointment for me. I played with the tester in store and really liked the colour, but each pan is unique. By that I mean that the white and pink shades differ. I actually purchased 2 of the Pink (online because my store didn't have them) and both had more of the white than pink.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P401602,295,$48.00,4.2407,Highlighting Powder,,,"I own both. I'm curious about the reviews complaining about the glitter. It's a highlighter so there is a chance of some glitter. Some people like glitter. The Bronze color has some glitter, the Pink does not. The Bronze color is not that pigmented... the formula is still silky, it's just a bit sheer. So building it up could result in too much glitter. To take off some of the glitter you can buff over your application with a clean, dense brush.

The Pink is amazing. One of my favorite highlighters. I guess if you only applied one swipe it could be considered subtle. But it builds up really quickly and I find it quite metallic. It reflects light beautifully and has a romantic feel. It looks rose-goldish in the pan but on the skin it has a white-ish silvery overlay. It doesn't appear glittery to me!

I really want a product that doesn't feel like I'm wearing a lot of makeup, protects and moisturizes, and also makes my skin look nicer. However, I'm just not a person who likes to wear a lot of makeup for everyday activities. I tried drugstore brands, Clinique, Stila, Usually they were greasy, heavy, the color was streaky and too orange. So I just didn't bother with foundation. But my skin is just not what it once was. I started looking again for something that met my needs and saw good reviews for this. The price put me off, but I tried it.
Well... this is the best tinted moisturizer I have found. Now, it *is not* going to give you lots of coverage. Big red spots will need concealer. This will ever so slightly even the tone of skin and hide a bit of redness or blueness in my case. The color matching is perfect for me to. I bought Extra Light which is truly light and does not have an orange look to it. Matching my skin color alone is a feat. Lastly, I can wear it all day. It lasts much longer than I'd expect it to, and melts over my skin so that it is easy to wash off in the evening.

I have very fair and very dry skin. If your skin is as dry as mine you may still need to put some moisturizer on before this or else it will catch a bit on the dry patches. Otherwise this is the most perfect tinted moisturizer I've found. If you are looking for very light coverage plus some protection and moisture without stiffness then the BB Cream delivers!",,,,5,blueelm

Like, I have become a little psychotic about making my skin as perfect as possible, but stuff still happens and a random spot still arises. With this, though, it covers it. I'd say it's medium coverage, maybe medium-light (I never ever wear full coverage or anything near it so my perception may be skewed). Anyway, I look in the mirror, and it's kind of shocking how perfect my skin looks. I get compliments on my skin, and maybe part of it's me and my skin routine, but I'm going to largely thank this product. I will say that if you use alabaster in her other products, such as the tinted moisturizer, like me, extra light is slightly too dark, just enough such that I have to take a bit extra care in applying it, though putting on a moisturizer first helps as I think they can kind of mix together to make it even easier to blend.",,,,5,candyfloss1

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P375910,608,$46.00,3.9391,BB Cream SPF 35,,,"While i gave this product a 5/5 rating, keep in mind that face products are very relative to the type of skin that you have.  After reading the not so great reviews, I realized that the people who did not like this bb cream have more normal to dry skin, sensitive skin, and prefer a very thin product with a natural finish.  I, on the other hand, have very normal skin.  Occasionally I am more oily and sometime I get dry patches and sometime I break out - the normal in my opinion.  This bb cream is thicker, however, it dries!  That is a problem for people with dry skin, however, great for people with normal to oily skin.  I love that I don't have to set it because it truly sets itself. It is thicker and what i found is that it is also somewhat buildable because it sets.  I have slight scaring and pigmentation, but I dont like to feel a lot of product on my face.  I just put a tiny pea size amount all over the face and then give it a sec, then i pop just a tad more on the specific areas I want.  If you have dry patches this is not for you.  You need something a bit more hydrating.  I also struggle with finding a bb cream that doesn't feel cakey because sometimes I am more oily.  I love the laura mercia tinted moisturizer, but it isn't enough.  The nars one is great but i am allergic to nars products, and other ones, such as buxom, smashbox, and many others tend to be so wet that i can't set it and it just ends up more work for me. 

This bb cream is perfect for you if you have normal to oily skin, and perhaps would like to still cover spots but with a very natural and radiant finish all while practically setting itself!",,,,5,lexxijo

To be prepared for the dryness, I always use very moisturizing cream in the morning before I apply this, such as La Mer Soft Cream. After I put it on, the color matches so well that it looks like I have nothing on but just very even undertone and clean look. I chose not to put on setting powder all over the face like I would do for my Boscia BB cream. Instead I only brush gently on the T-zone, and it's done! It doesn't get oily or darkened the whole day.

My skin looks so nice after putting this on and has more of a foundation coverage vs a tinted moisturizer. Now I want to try more bobby brown products.

Even when I load up on the moisturizer beforehand something about this product does NOT look good hours later. It is winter and I'm more combo, but still! Also, don't even THINK about applying this w/o a brush - it looks awful. I use a synthetic brush which helps with the even coverage.

Pros: 
- it completely dissolved my rosacea in a week. It did something no treatment could do! My skin is not red anymore and I don't have pimples (this is the reason I gave it three stars instead of one for performance) 
- shade light perfectly matches my skin, it's somehow neutral, not too pink, not too yellow (though I would need to buy darker one for summer) 
- doesn't oxidize 

Cons:
- sets fast, I have to do my whole face in 30 seconds otherwise I have thick layers at some place and nothing on others
- it's impossible to use any other cream product with it, they will cake (forget about concealer) 
- doesn't last long, only half of the day if set with powder and you need to wipe it all out before reapplying it otherwise you'll have a patchy face
- clings to dry patches and accentuates skin texture on dry areas 

The performance of this stuff is awful, but healing properties are 5++. I hesitated for couple of weeks but decide to return it since there is no way to blend it into my skin.",,,,3,KateWay
Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P375910,608,$46.00,3.9391,BB Cream SPF 35,,,"I sought the perfect foundation for a long time, and tried a LOT of different products and types of makeup -- powder and liquid foundations, BB creams, CC creams, etc. None of them quite gave me the look and feel I was looking for, or if they did, that look only lasted 4 hours and I don't have the time or interest in reapplying my entire face multiple times in a day.

Finally, I came across a sample of the Bobbi Brown BB Cream in Extra Light. I'm normally pretty fair with neutral undertones, but have recently been in the sun and gotten a slight tan, and this color STILL matches, which is freaking unheard-of.

Anyway, I digress. The color is great, but what I really love about this product is the feel. I don't like the mask-like feeling of a lot of liquid and powder foundations, but I still need a medium amount of coverage to even out my skin. This BB cream succeeds in both regards. The coverage is enough to perfect my skin and give me a much more even look, while not feeling or looking like I’m wearing any makeup. I still need to use a little bit of concealer to cover a little bit of redness and sometimes dark under-eye circles, but overall this BB cream is excellent at covering up problem areas while still looking natural. This would probably also be great for ladies with freckles, as it’ll provide coverage but not completely block them out. I use the MUFE HD Primer and MUFE HD Microfinish Powder afterwards, and my makeup will stay on well into the night without needing a touch-up! The SPF 35 in this is enough to where I don’t need to apply additional sunscreen on an average day, and it’s moisturizing enough to not ever get flakey or cakey looking (a problem which plagued me when I was using powder and liquid foundations), but never feels greasy. It’s creamy and super easy to apply, I just use my fingers and it works fine.

Overall, this is my new favorite BB cream, beating out the MUFE and Smashbox ones by a long shot.",,,,5,CultOfMadness

TEXTURE - Nice and creamy, but felt tacky on the skin after application. My skin did feel supple, and dry patches were not visible.

FINISH - I felt I had a nice dewy complexion, NOT as shiny one.

APPLICATION - Very simple. I preferred my fingers or a sponge, because a brush sometimes left brush strokes.

WEAR - It lasted most of the day for me. It did not crease.

My CONS
Over a year ago, I bought this from Bobbi Brown, before Sephora carried it. Assuming the ingredients of the current BB Cream is the same as when I had bought it, I have a couple problems with it.
1. If I applied it with my fingers, I always had to wash my hands. I don't mean a light wash; I really had to rub my hands together with soap to remove it.
2. PRODUCT TRANSFER - If my face touched anything (putting on my clothes, hugging someone, etc.), the product would transfer onto whatever my face touched. EVEN after SETTING POWDER. And I've tried different setting techniques.
3. My skin felt tacky after application, even later in the day.",,,,3,

I really love this bronzer. Other brands (Benefit's Hoola, Too Faced Chocolate Soleil, etc) tend to break me out, as I have fairly sensitive skin. I don't have that reaction with this bronzer, which is amazing.

The colour is great, but since it's incredibly pigmented you can easily overdo it. Regardless, it looks pretty natural and I enjoy how it looks on my fair skin. If you are super fair you might want to use a light hand when applying this, since it's very pigmented.

I will say that this is quite pricy. It's $49 for 0.28oz - compared to Too Faced Chocolate Soleil $38 for 0.35oz, and Benefit Hoola $36 for 0.28oz.

I have a fair skin complexion and use the light tan color.
Because of my pale skin color I was searching for months for a bronzing powder that suited me best. I tried this for the first time last month, have been using it ever since and find it perfect for me.

It is smooth to touch and very easy to blend which makes it extremely natural looking for daytime use or when I’m looking for a subtle sun kissed look. However, for a darker, tanned look it is also simple to use the product to build up the depth of tan.

It also has very little shimmer, which allows me to contour using a separate highlighter when I want.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P270548,441,$44.00,4.6803,Bronzer,brown,,"I write reviews very rarely, but felt the urge as I noticed a couple people bought Medium and weren't satisfied because it was orange. My skin is light/medium with yellow undertones and this was exactly my experience: Medium = orange. However, the shade NATURAL is absolutely perfect and extremely natural (I've had so many people comment that I look tan/healthy and they have no clue I am wearing makeup) - I highly recommend anyone who tried Medium (and looked orange) to buy Natural. I finished a compact of Natural (took about 11 months using almost daily), bought Medium because I wanted to try something different (big mistake) - and now I am back to Natural. I use the Bobbi Brown bronzing brush and a very light hand, and the application really is beautiful. Even if your skin is medium or close to medium - if Medium makes you look orange, try out Natural! I also think wearing primer underneath makes a difference in the appearance of this bronzer (I wait 10 minutes between applying primer and applying makeup - it doesn't have to add too much time to your routine! I brush my teeth/get dressed/anything else to get ready for the day in that period!) And because the bronzer is matte, you can apply a highlighter on the cheeks underneath.

Light (or Golden Light as it's actually named) doesn't have those awful orange undertones like so many other bronzers and it's light enough in color that it doesn't look ""dirty"" on my skin. The matte finish gives this product a really natural look and it allows me to get away with a shimmery blush or highlighting illuminators when I feel like it. There are few things I hate more than an overly sparkly face. As I've found with most Bobbi products, this bronzer is just barely noticeable with a light hand, but can be easily built up into more saturated tones for a deeper tan.

I also have a pet peeve that I will not wear mascara that takes me ten minutes to get off, this mascara is easy to remove at the end of the day which I appreciate. My Mom is the most picky hard to please person when it comes to mascara, she is that person who will sit with a magnifying mirror and separate her eyelashes with a needle, but she also swears by this mascara. I can't say enough good things about it.

I have used the Bobbi Brown Everything mascara in the past and what I liked about it was that it felt light weight on my lashes. The Smokey Eye mascara is similar in that not much of the product came off onto the wand, meaning you didn't get huge globs of mascara binding your lashes together. This allows you to layer and separate, however I found it was best to do one coat, dry, comb, and then a second coat. I wouldn't say this is very thickening as much as it is defining. My only qualm is that it feels heavy and less pliable than some other mascaras I have used in the past and I don't like my lashes feeling crunchy. In flash photography, lashes appear slightly glossy and quite full, as well as in darker lighting. In natural lighting, they are not overwhelming or chunky.
The wand itself is very basic and quite firm, so you are able to manipulate it. It's not too thick so getting to the smaller, pesky lashes is less of a problem than some of those larger wands can bode.
Overall, I give it four stars because the product sets a little too dry for my taste. This is an every day mascara that doesn't give you a huge WOW factor but does look nice in just about any lighting.",,light,,4,isabee

Blended very well with my usual foundation and did not look muddy at all (although, as was expected, the shade did make me look sick and gaunt).

I have applied them by directly swiping the stick on my eye, and by using a brush to pick up colour from the stick and then applying it on my eye. Both work well, but I prefer just applying directly to my eye, then smudging the edges with a brush. I find if I smudge with my finger I have less control and the colour almost disappears because it gets lifted off with by my finger. Smudging with my finger also causes patchiness. 

Smokey Blue Grey and Sand Dune are great. They are matt and apply evenly and blend easily without patchiness (with a brush).

Smokey Blue Grey is actually just grey - but on the blue (cool) end of the colour scale, there is no obvious blue at all.  
Sand Dune is a peach tone sand. Not too peach, not too brown. It's a perfect nude for my pale skin tone (NC15 in Mac foundation). I use Sand Dune alone on no makeup-makeup days. It gives my blue eyes a nice pop, makes me look awake and refreshed, but like I have no makeup on at all. 

Both are perfect on eyes with any creepy skin or lines because they are matt they do not show any imperfections. 

Violet Plum is shimmery and is very patchy when applied either by brush or finger. With and without primer (although you are not suppose to need primer with these anyway.

Violet Plum is a beautiful purple. It says light lavender on the description, but it's actually on the darker side. But it does show as true purple - not muddy like many purple shades. Unfortunately this one shows all lines and really accentuates creepiness. 

I returned the purple stick and now use BB Long Wear Gel Eyeliner in Violet Purple instead. It's actually the exact same colour, but matt so it doesn't show creepiness. The eyeliner can be smudged to work as cream eyeshadow (no patchiness either). I use the BB gel eyeliner in Cobalt and Black Scotch the same way - as eyeshadows. 


This is a great product, highly recommend, but keep in mind if you have any creepy skin to stay away from the shimmery ones. I will continue to buy the matt ones as the colour saturation is great, these are super easy to use when you want a quick makeup look, and BB has colours not found in powders.

That being said, this foundation stick is some of the heaviest feeling makeup I've ever had on. It's like wearing a mask. I used the stick directly on my skin and then used a brush (from the Sephora contour kit) to distribute it on my face and neck. You've got probably less than a minute to get it to distribute evenly for proper coverage before it gets stiff and unmovable, and that's over an spf moisturizer underneath and Bare Mineral's ""Prime Time"" primer on top of that. Thick feeling aside, it's the best coverage I've ever had, photographed EXTREMELY WELL (hence, using it for my wedding), and it was even pretty easy to contour with. I used it with Make Up Forever's Full Cover Concealer and Nars blush and bronzer duo in Laguna/Orgasm.
I give this foundation stick five stars because Bobbi Brown has the most natural looking foundation colors, because it photographed so well, and because it lasted all night. Since the wedding, I've worn it to special events and date nights and it always looks great. If you're used to wearing foundation every single day, you probably won't think twice about the texture/weigh of it--(I'm a tinted moisturizer gal at heart.)

I don't use this as foundation, but is you need full coverage, then this product would work because it blends well and won't look heavy.

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P270549,1063,$46.00,4.1825,Skin Foundation Stick,blue,,"I have a 10 year history with this product and the old version of it, and this is an EXTREMELY underrated foundation. It isn't very glamorous on terms of trends or buzzwords, and it isn't super high coverage to the point where it works any miracles per se- however, it is very uncommonly good and most girls don't even bother trying it: so I challenge you to try it, go to Sephora and get color matched, and see what I'm talking about. My experience with this product has always been good, I even took it with me everywhere in Hawaii and put my makeup on at the beach when it was time to leave and go to dinner. I found that this foundation works really well for sun-exposed skin, mine drank the moisture but the color stayed intact. It also works well if you go tanning, or if your skin is annoyed at the winter weather, or any low humidity environment. All you need to do is kind of scribble this on your face and then blend it around. SUPER easy. If you have pinker areas, you can go back after the first thin layer and dab the stick on it and pat it in, and for blemishes or redness around the nose etc: the touch up stick concealer is a much more pigmented, small version of the foundation stick and therefore works amazingly well with it. It really feels like not wearing makeup if you don't pile it on- the key is to be realistic about your skin type and its condition. If you have a lot of issues to cover and one thin layer blended into the skin (medium coverage) doesn't look around 90% perfect, or you don't like your skin to shine through and like really heavy coverage, you are going to end up applying way too much and that is when people complain about it making them really shiny. Personally, I like my skin to just look like really good skin, and when I get freckles from the sun I don't want to mask them. On normal-dry skin types, you don't need to set this with powder. The moisture will absorb and it will stay on, but I won't lie and say it's transfer-resistant. No stick foundation ever is. Setting it would definitely keep it on longer, though. On normal to dry skin, as long as you exfoliate regularly no primer is needed under this. If your skin is oily, you'd need an oil controlling primer and a powder to set this, because it isn't designed for oily skin. However, if you have excessively oily skin, you should really be taking care of that with your skincare and not trying to control it with makeup. I would say hands down the best skincare to control that would be the Fresh Umbrian Clay skincare products. The best primer for this foundation is the Veil primer by Hourglass. Best powder to set this is the NARS loose powder (not the clear powder though- the one that comes in colors.) Anyway, I hope that info helps someone.",,fair,normal,5,heatherm

pros:
-colour range
-i don't find that it disrupts my primer like other stick formulations ive tried
-blush and bronzer are still visible after about 8 hours of wear.
-it has a very natural look too it when it sets. doesn't completely dry which i personally prefer. would however recommend setting your nose/under eyes/etc with powder so it doesn't slip.
-does a great job of covering redness/uneven tone which are my main concerns

cons:
-THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT IN THE TUBE
-less coverage than the original formulation. pat it in with your finger as opposed to blending with a brush in spots that need more concealing. you'll waste less product this way.
-would imagine it would cling to dry spots and break down if you're too oily. probably not your best bet if you're on the extreme ends of the spectrum.
-don't buy it if you have a lot of fuzz on your face...it wont stick.. need not elaborate...

Bobbi Brown,Makeup,P270539,2295,$27.00,4.3011,Long-Wear Gel Eyeliner,brown,,"There's a bit of a learning curve when using this product especially if you're not used to gel liner in a pot. But once you get it down to a pat, it's great. It stays all day and stays really black all day. It's super waterproof and it stays ON during sweaty workouts.
 
The product CAN become dry..which is bound to happen if you constantly leave it uncapped while applying eyeliner. 

But here are a few tricks to keep it long lasting.
1) When not in use, turn the gel liner pot upside down. Do this since Day 1 and prolong it as long as you can.
2) If you see that it's not as smooth during application. Put in a little drop of castor oil. Castor oil is a natural product and is multi-purpose, including the use we want it for - dilution. Work it how you want..you can swirl it so it covers the whole surface of the pot and it will sink in. If you put too much..take a tissue to dab off excess.

If you don't have castor oil, you can use makeup remover. Any would do, but cleansing oil may work better.

If you're thinking of getting this, opt for the holiday kit ""Line & Define Long-Wear Eye Set"" while in stock - which comes with a full size gel liner, brush (short handle), full size mascara, and small cleansing oil (perfect for tip #2!). The price is fantastic ...getting the brush and gel liner almost covers the cost of the set if you're shopping in the US and it's actually a better deal to get the set if you're shopping in Canada.",,fair,,5,susiechoo

It does a good job covering dark under aye spots; depending on how bad they are they could disappear or, as it is in my case, become barely noticeable.
It is a little heavy so I won’t think of it as buildable, even with only one application, if you go to thick, it kind of cracks and also settles into fine lines making them more noticeable (this depends on a lot on the texture of your under eye skin). It can get worst if you exceed settling powder on top cause it will get cakey.
It can be drying, so I always apply a good moisturizer first.

I've found the best application method is to dab around the eye area with my fingers. I was recommended a brush at Sephora, but I find it just moves the product around and doesn't really provide coverage. Using my fingers also warms up the product, which seems dry in the pan but a little bit of body heat brings out the creaminess.

Before this, I was constantly searching for a foundation that would be perfect for me, and it wasn't an easy task. I need a foundation suitable for my normal-to-dry skin that's also incredibly sensitive and prone to redness AND pale without having overwhelming pink undertones. I've probably tried a dozen or so foundations, and this is the only one that's fit all the criteria. It feels so nice on the skin and doesn't irritate it, and Porcelain is a great shade for me. (While Alabaster matches my chest, the pink tones would clash with my facial redness.) The coverage is light-to-medium, which I like because redness is my only real issue.

If you're more into full coverage (think Double Wear or Lock-It), this is definitely not for you.

Before I say anything else about this product, I have to give a heads up that if you're looking for heavy coverage, you might want to skip this one. Although, I've never been a fan of heavy coverage foundations in the first place because it doesn't let my skin breathe and makes it feel extremely clogged and uncomfortable. That's why I absolutely fell in love with this. It's the most natural looking foundation I've ever tried. Ever. It actually does look invisible on the skin but still gives light to medium coverage that feels weightless. And for that extra coverage, I found that it's best to wait about 1-2 minutes for the previous layer to dry before applying the next. Or you can just apply your favourite concealer to problem areas. The only downside to this foundation is that it doesn't last nearly as long as others I've tried. I guess that's a given since the formula itself feels watery, which is probably the reason it blends in with the skin so well. I have a pretty hectic schedule and on a good day, it will last a bit less than 5 hours. With a proper primer and setting spray, it lasts about 5 and a half or less than 6 hours.

The only redeeming qualities of are that it is buildable and requires very little in the application because the consistency is nice and thin. Performance is just not there.

I did my makeup at 5:45 this morning (ugh!) and I didn't come home until 8:30 tonight. I didn't do any touchups during the day. To my amazement, when I looked in the mirror, my foundation still looked good! Not powder-fresh perfect, but good - like if I had a date to go to tonight, I wouldn't redo my makeup. Good like my first thought wasn't ""oh noes, how long have I looked like this?""

Fifteen hours of wear time and I didn't have any greasy or oily spots where the foundation had slid off. No caking, no creasing, no clumping in weird patches, no redness peeking through, and absolutely no oxidation or discoloration. Just a nice slightly dewy finish.

Coverage is controllable. I'm light-handed with foundation (I hate and fear cake face). I can build this formula on my cheeks and forehead to even out my complexion and sheer it out on my jawline and temples where my skin is naturally even and smooth. I can still see some of the blemishes and post-acne hyperpigmentation, but the redness is neutralized and the contrast difference is minimal.

I wear Sand 2, a perfect neutral light tone. I would call it the lightest of the light shades and just a smidge too dark to be the darkest of the fair shades. It's not pink, not yellow, not orange and it matches my skin more closely than any other foundation.

I have a fair skin tone so I feel like every blemish, dot, redness on my face shows up no matter what I do. I don't have a lot of acne, I just occasionally get a pimple here or there every month. I mostly have an oily t-zone, redness in my skin, some acne scarring, and generally an uneven skintone. I love that polished it doesn't look like I'm wearing makeup but I just happen to have flawless TV perfect skin all the time look, and this finally gave me that. Before, because of my oily t-zone, with other foundations they all betrayed me. If it was a hot day or it was late at night and I had been wearing other foundations all day, they would get that cakey look or start melting on my face. This stays put, has yet to betray me, and if I accidentally put on too much it doesn't ever look cakey or overdone. It gives excellent coverage and covers everything I need making it look like I just naturally have the most beautiful skin ever. I went on a foundation spree in which I got samples from a bunch of different brands (burberry, armani, YSL, Marc Jacobs, you name it I tried it). I realized for every skin type, you definitely need to invest in a good primer and do a trial and error with foundations to see if it works best for you.

I have horrible combination skin with oily cheeks and nose, but dry skin flakes in the winter and when I use certain acne medicines or retinol creams. I tried about 5 other foundations including MUF, NARS, Dior and Revlon.

BB Skin Foundation: This is the first foundation that really makes me glow, doesn't settle into my overly large pores, forehead lines, or dry skin flakes. I can apply it with my fingers or a foundation brush with great results - blends like a dream. It also lasts all day. It's a little pricey, but like the other reviewers said, a little goes a long way.

About the Colors: I will say that I was shade tested twice, once at Sephora and again at a Bobbi Brown makeup counter, and both suggested the shade Warm Sand for my light skin with cool tones. I protested that I'm cool toned, and clearly, this is for a warm toned person. Oh man, I was so wrong. I took home a sample and used it for a week, and lo and behold, Warm Sand is perfect.

Using some other products, I had my skin under control and only used a Korean BB cream in the winter, which was wonderful for my complexion. It only came in one shade and as summer hit, my skin darkened and I looked ridiculous in the BB cream. So I started browsing foundations, which often sunk into my pores, melted on my face (in the bad way) or just flat out gave bad coverage and made me break out.

I'm glad I tried this Bobbi Brown foundation. I was getting ready to go out with a girl who was using it to get ready, and though she has nicer skin than I, I was really impressed so I decided to have this be my foundation.

I got sand, which fits my lighter skin pretty well and matches the tone perfectly. It feels super watery compared to what I'm used to, but goes on pleasantly strong. I usually do a cover layers, and it covers all of the way and looks very natural. I finish with Microfinish powder and it looks fresh and natural. It covers my redness and any acne I have very well, and doesn't sink into my pores or wrinkles. I received many compliments on my skin after wearing this, so I'm pleased. I haven't tried the long wear version, and I don't want to. I haven't broken out so far, and I ordered this a few weeks ago.

I know the price is steep, but if you have uneven skin with redness and stupidly large pores, give this a try. Shake it up before you use it so it mixes nicely and thickens up just a bit. It goes on smoothly both with my fingers and with my Urban Decay brush.

One last thing, it is a foundation I touch up. I work 12 hour shifts that are highly physical, and especially in the summer I sweat a lot.

Being fair I have a difficult time finding foundations that are light enough to match me! Usually I settle for whatever I can find and have to blend it all the way down my neck and use bronzer to blend everything together. NO MORE! The shade Alabaster matches my neck PERFECTLY and I don't even have to bring it onto my neck at all, i stop right underneath my jaw because it's literally that spot on.
I also LOVE this formula. It's almost undetectable on the skin! It's a very fluid foundation and if you don't have much to cover you will love it! Even if you have some spots (post acne marks/sun spots etc.) you can still use this foundation all over to create a naturally flawless canvas then spot conceal only where you need it. I first tried it with the beauty blender and although the results were great I think it sponge thinned the product a little too much (but builds great) and I had to use a couple layers. I prefer to buff this foundation into the skin and using the Real Techniques Buffing Brush or the Expert Face Brush.
The finish of this foundation is slightly dewy and it almost seems to disappear into your skin. You can't even tell there is foundation on the skin, literally! It does a great job of evening out redness/uneven tone and feels really light weight.
When I have blemishes I still use this foundation but will spot conceal with a fuller coverage concealer (Nars radiant creamy) and still have great, natural looking results.I wear my foundations all day (12+ hours) and don't notice any fading/wearing off.

I have both highly combination skin as well as a weird in between pigment of yellow and pink. Foundations usually look too pink or way too yellow on my skin. I found Sand 2 blends into my skin tone like it was made for me.This foundation goes on like a charm and blends easily. It provides great coverage with one fine layer but it's easy to build up the colour to your preferred coverage.
It's lightweight on the skin and looks natural. It leaves a very gentle, natural-looking glow. I bought this bottle in 9 months ago and still have a remarkable amount left over. I couldn't recommend this product enough.",,fair,combination,5,jfurball

And then I went into Sephora for the first time, told the salesgirl what I wanted - a foundation that looked like bare skin, light to medium coverage, and a brand with a good reputation for matching skin tone. The salesgirl said I know exactly what foundation you want, Bobbi Brown. I choked on the price tag thinking ""good grief I've never spent money on makeup this expensive"". She used a brush to apply it and it was like heaven opened up and the angels started singing. The foundation was the exact match for my skin colour and disappeared on my face.

A little history about my skin (helpful for someone with similar skin type). I have hormonal acne around the chin area and my t-zone and sides of my cheeks get very oily (this started happening about 2 years ago). I've tried EVERYTHING to tame the oils, but nothing has been helping. I've tried literally every primer, moisturizer and i've even had a prescription from my doctor for spironolactone which did not help just made me really dry around my chin area and that area was not my issue! All the matte foundations stopped working for me too (they would work for 2-3 weeks and than my skin would get immune to it I guess and would get oily)

I thought i had lost hope and nothing would work until I came across this face base. My skin is divine, smooth, barely any breakouts and it smells incredible! I still do get a bit oily, but its not like before and it tends to get oily in the evening time when I get home from work. (I apply my make up on at 6am and by the time I notice I am oily its 9pm).

Bobbi Brown,Skincare,P270594,443,$60.00,4.5305,Vitamin Enriched Face Base Moisturizer,,,"I had no intention of purchasing this item when I visited my local Sephora, but Bobbi Brown was a new addition to the store so it was very exciting. I just grabbed this really pretty jar and the manager was walking by and just gushed about how amazing it was. So I went for it (yolo) and bought it. My skin-type is very true to combination-oily type. Oily in the T-zone, dry on the cheeks. I have redness near my nose and hyper-pigmentation so I scar easily. Because of this, I am very particular with my skincare and have stuck with my long morning routine for years. I was looking forward to seeing how this product would help. I use it after my moisturizer but before my primer because, as I was told by my local Sephora, it's not a primer. I'm sure many reviews make it a point to mention this, but OH MY GOODNESS IT SMELLS AMAZING. A little goes a long way here as well. I only use it during the day and it's lasted me a while. I'm working on getting my second jar as we speak. I would absolutely recommend this product. My skin feels softer and my tone is much more even. It doesn't help control the oil (I was not expecting it to) but it doesn't contribute to the oiliness either. It's been a great addition to my morning skincare routine. If you're curious about it, ask for a sample. It's definitely worth a shot and I have not regretting the investment in this item so far.",,,combination,5,mariesamantha

The consistency is a little iffy when it's on my fingers but the second I rub it into my face, I'm like melting with the cream. The smell is citrusy and clean, my boyfriend loves the smell of it.

She first started off by cleaning my face then putting on this moisturizer, which smells just divine, all over my face. It smells fruity, like a grapefruit and/or pineapple, maybe? It is very easy to apply and what's best is that it is oil controlling! It works perfectly for me since if I do not put any moisturizer on before applying makeup, it gets flakey. Most moisturizers didn't help much either, so I was so happy and surprised that this product worked perfectly for me! It is so perfect, it moisturizes with shea butter and controls oil at the same time!

It just makes your skin feel plump and happy. I use this year round, even when I lived in 110 degree Texas in the Summer.

I agree that this makes makeup look great, however my forehead would actually wind up being oilier than usual by mid-afternoon.

I tried this twice. once with a moisturizer and primer and once on it's own. I preferred it on it's own as it wasn't as greasy. the finished look was a bit shiny but it held up really well. my foundation looked freshly applied after about 8 hours!
